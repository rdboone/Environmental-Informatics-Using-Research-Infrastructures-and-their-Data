### About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing 
different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect 
hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands 
that support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the 
earth's surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands -- up to hundreds of 
bands -- that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.

The NEON imaging spectrometer collects data within the 380nm to 2510nm portions 
of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5nm in 
width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately 
426 bands - which means big, big data.

## Key Metadata for Hyperspectral Data

### Bands and Wavelengths

A *band* represents a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values 
between 695nm and 700nm might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. 
The imaging spectrometer collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light 
in that band. Often when you work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the 
band information is reported as the center wavelength value. This value 
represents the center point value of the wavelengths represented in that band. 
Thus in a band spanning 695-700 nm, the center would be 697.5).

    defined bands or regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Source: National 
    Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)


### Spectral Resolution
The spectral resolution of a dataset that has more than one band, refers to the 
width of each band in the dataset. In the example above, a band was defined as 
spanning 695-700nm. The width or spatial resolution of the band is thus 5 
nanometers. To see an example of this, check out the band widths for the 
<a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/band_designations_landsat_satellites.php" target="_blank">Landsat sensors</a>.

 
### Full Width Half Max (FWHM)
The full width half max (FWHM) will also often be reported in a multi or 
hyperspectral dataset. This value represents the spread of the band around that 
center point. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/FWHM2.png)

>The Full Width Half Max (FWHM) of a band relates to the distance 
    in nanometers between the band center and the edge of the band. In this 
    case, the FWHM for Band C is 5 nm.


In the illustration above, the band that covers 695-700nm has a FWHM of 5 nm. 
While a general spectral resolution of the sensor is often provided, not all 
sensors create bands of uniform widths. For instance bands 1-9 of Landsat 8 are 
listed below (Courtesy of <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov" target="_blank">USGS</a>)


| Band | Wavelength range (microns) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (microns)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - Coastal aerosol | 0.43 - 0.45 | 30 | 0.02 |
| Band 2 - Blue | 0.45 - 0.51 | 30 | 0.06 |
| Band 3 - Green | 0.53 - 0.59 | 30 | 0.06 |
| Band 4 - Red | 0.64 - 0.67 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 5 - Near Infrared (NIR) | 0.85 - 0.88 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 6 - SWIR 1 | 1.57 - 1.65 | 30 | 0.08  |
| Band 7 - SWIR 2 | 2.11 - 2.29 | 30 | 0.18 |
| Band 8 - Panchromatic | 0.50 - 0.68 | 15 | 0.18 |
| Band 9 - Cirrus | 1.36 - 1.38 | 30 | 0.02 |



## Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format

> Contributors: Felipe Sanchez, Leah A. Wasser, Edmund Hart, Donal O'Leary
> Based on NEON Science Tutorial Series: https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series

In this tutorial, we will explore reading and extracting spatial raster data 
stored within a HDF5 file using R. 

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

### Learning Objectives
After completing this section, you will be able to:

* Explain how HDF5 data can be used to store spatial data and the associated 
benefits of this format when working with large spatial data cubes.
* Extract metadata from HDF5 files.
* Slice or subset HDF5 data. You will extract one band of pixels. 
* Plot a matrix as an image and a raster.
* Export a final GeoTIFF (spatially projected) that can be used both in further 
analysis and in common GIS tools like QGIS.



### R Libraries to Install:

* **rhdf5**: `install.packages("BiocManager")`, `BiocManager::install("rhdf5")`
* **raster**: `install.packages('raster')`
* **rgdal**: `install.packages('rgdal')`



### Data to Download

The data were collected over the San Joaquin field site located in California 
(Domain 17) and processed at NEON headquarters. This data subset is derived from 
the mosaic tile named NEON_D17_SJER_DP3_257000_4112000_reflectance.h5.

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this section, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).


## About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing 
different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect 
hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands that 
support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the Earth's 
surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands - up to hundreds of bands - 
that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.

The NEON imaging spectrometer (NIS) collects data within the 380 nm to 2510 nm 
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5 nm 
in width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately 
428 bands - which means BIG DATA. *Remember* that the example dataset used 
here only has 1 out of every 4 bands included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset 
(this substantially reduces size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, 
we will note the band numbers for this example dataset, which may be different 
from NEON production data.

>A data cube of NEON hyperspectral data. Each layer in the cube 
  represents a band.

 
The HDF5 data model natively compresses data stored within it (makes it smaller) 
and supports data slicing (extracting only the portions of the data that you 
need to work with rather than reading the entire dataset into memory). These 
features in addition to the ability to support spatial data and associated 
metadata make it ideal for working with large data cubes such as those generated 
by imaging spectrometers.


In this section we will explore reading and extracting spatial raster data 
stored within a HDF5 file using R. 

##  Read HDF5 data into R
We will use the `raster` and `rhdf5` packages to read in the HDF5 file that 
contains hyperspectral data for the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank">NEON San Joaquin (SJER) field site</a>. 
Let's start by calling the needed packages and reading in our NEON HDF5 file.  

Please be sure that you have *at least* version 2.10 of `rhdf5` installed. Use: 
`packageVersion("rhdf5")` to check the package version. 

```{r install-load-library, warning=FALSE}

# Load `raster` and `rhdf5` packages and read NIS data into R
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)
library(rgdal)


# Define the file name to be opened
f <- ('./data/NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5')
```

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** To update all packages installed in 
R, use `update.packages()`.
</div>

```{r view-file-strux, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
# look at the HDF5 file structure 
head(h5ls(f,all=T))
```

When you look at the structure of the data, take note of the "map info" dataset,
the "Coordinate_System" group, and the "wavelength" and "Reflectance" datasets. The
"Coordinate_System" folder contains the spatial attributes of the data including its
EPSG Code, which is easily converted to a Coordinate Reference System (CRS). 
The CRS documents how the data are physically located on the Earth. The "wavelength" 
dataset contains the middle wavelength values for each band in the data. The 
"Reflectance" dataset contains the image data that we will use for both data processing 
and visualization.

their associated metadata.

Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data</a> -this tutorial explains more about 
metadata and important concepts associated with multi-band (multi and 
hyperspectral) rasters.

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip - HDF5 Structure:** Note that the structure
of individual HDF5 files may vary depending on who produced the data. In this
case, the Wavelength and reflectance data within the file are both datasets.
However, the spatial information is contained within a group. Data downloaded from
another organization like NASA, may look different. This is why it's important to
explore the data before diving into using it!
</div>

We can use the `h5readAttributes()` function to read and extract metadata from the 
HDF5 file. Let's start by learning about the wavelengths described within this file.

```{r read-band-wavelength-attributes }

# get information about the wavelengths of this dataset
wavelengthInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")
wavelengthInfo

```

Next, we can use the `h5read` function to read the data contained within the
HDF5 file. Let's read in the wavelengths of the band centers:

```{r read-band-wavelengths }
# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")
head(wavelengths)
tail(wavelengths)

```

Which wavelength is band 6 associated with? 

(Hint: look at the wavelengths 
vector that we just imported and check out the data located at index 6 - 
`wavelengths[6]`).

>482 nanometers falls within the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Source: National Ecological Observatory Network 


Band 6 has a associate wavelength center of 481.7032 nanometers (nm) which is 
in the blue portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (~ 400-700 nm). 

### Bands and Wavelengths

A *band* represents 
a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values between 695 nm and 700 nm 
might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. The imaging spectrometer
collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light in that band. Often when you 
work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the band information is reported as 
the center wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the 
wavelengths represented in that  band. Thus in a band spanning 695-700 nm, the 
center would be 697.5 nm). The full width half max (FWHM) will also be reported. 
This value represents the spread of the band around that center point. So, a band 
that covers 800 nm-805 nm might have a FWHM of 5 nm and a wavelength value of 
802.5 nm. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/spectrumZoomed.png)

> Bands represent a range of values (types of light) within the 
    electromagnetic spectrum. Values for each band are often represented as the 
    center point value of each band. Source: National Ecological Observatory 
    Network (NEON)


The HDF5 dataset that we are working with in this activity may contain more 
information than we need to work with. For example, we don't necessarily need 
to process all 107 bands available in this example dataset (or all 426 bands 
available in a full NEON hyperspectral reflectance file, for that matter)
- if we are interested in creating a product like NDVI which only uses bands in 
the near infra-red and red portions of the spectrum. Or we might only be interested 
in a spatial subset of the data - perhaps a region where we have plots in the field.

The HDF5 format allows us to slice (or subset) the data - quickly extracting the 
subset that we need to process. Let's extract one of the green bands in our 
dataset - band 9. 

By the way - what is the center wavelength value associated 
with band 9? 

Hint: `wavelengths[9]`. 

How do we know this band is a green band in the visible portion of the spectrum?

In order to effectively subset our data, let's first read the important 
reflectance metadata stored as *attributes* in the "Reflectance_Data" dataset. 

```{r get-reflectance-shape}

# First, we need to extract the reflectance metadata:
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f, "/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data")
reflInfo

# Next, we read the different dimensions

nRows <- reflInfo$Dimensions[1]
nCols <- reflInfo$Dimensions[2]
nBands <- reflInfo$Dimensions[3]

nRows
nCols
nBands

```


The HDF5 read function reads data in the order: Bands, Cols, Rows. This is
different from how R reads data. We'll adjust for this later.

```{r get-reflectance-shape-2}
# Extract or "slice" data for band 9 from the HDF5 file
b9 <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",index=list(9,1:nCols,1:nRows)) 

# what type of object is b9?
class(b9)

```

### A Note About Data Slicing in HDF5
Data slicing allows us to extract and work with subsets of the data rather than 
reading in the entire dataset into memory. Thus, in this case, we can extract and 
plot the green band without reading in all 107 bands of information. The ability 
to slice large datasets makes HDF5 ideal for working with big data. 	

Next, let's convert our data from an array (more than 2 dimensions) to a matrix 
(just 2 dimensions). We need to have our data in a matrix format to plot it.

```{r convert-to-matrix}

# convert from array to matrix by selecting only the first band
b9 <- b9[1,,]

# check it
class(b9)

```


### Arrays vs. Matrices

Arrays are matrices with more than 2 dimensions. When we say dimension, we are 
talking about the "z" 
associated with the data (imagine a series of tabs in a spreadsheet). Put the other 
way: matrices are arrays with only 2 dimensions. Arrays can have any number of 
dimensions one, two, ten or more. 

Here is a matrix that is 4 x 3 in size (4 rows and 3 columns):

| Metric    | species 1 | species 2 |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| total number   | 23        | 45        |
| average weight | 14        | 5         |
| average length | 2.4       | 3.5       |
| average height | 32        | 12        |

### Dimensions in Arrays
An array contains 1 or more dimensions in the "z" direction. For example, let's 
say that we collected the same set of species data for every day in a 30 day month.
We might then have a matrix like the one above for each day for a total of 30 days 
making a 4 x 3 x 30 array (this dataset has more than 2 dimensions). More on R object 
types <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html">here</a> 
(links to external site, DataCamp).

> A matrix has only 2 dimensions

>An array has more than 2 dimensions.


Next, let's look at the metadata for the reflectance data. When we do this, take 
note of 1) the scale factor and 2) the data ignore value. Then we can plot the 
band 9 data. Plotting spatial data as a visual "data check" is a good idea to 
make sure processing is being performed correctly and all is well with the image. 

```{r read-attributes-plot, fig.cap=c("Plot of reflectance values for band 9 data. This plot shows a very washed out image lacking any detail.","Plot of log transformed reflectance values for band 9 data. Log transformation improved the visibility of details in the image, but it is still not great.")}
    
# look at the metadata for the reflectance dataset
h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data")

# plot the image
image(b9)
```

That is hard to visually interpret.
What happens if we plot a log of the data?
```{r}
image(log(b9))

```

What do you notice about the first image? It's washed out and lacking any detail. What 
could be causing this? It got better when plotting the log of the values, but 
still not great. 

Let's look at the distribution of reflectance values in 
our data to figure out what is going on.

```{r hist-data, fig.cap=c("Histogram of reflectance values for band 9. The x-axis represents the reflectance values and ranges from 0 to 8000. The frequency of these values is on the y-axis. The histogram shows reflectance values are skewed to the right, where the majority of the values lie between 0 and 1000. We can conclude that reflectance values are not equally distributed across the range of reflectance values, resulting in a washed out image.","Histogram of reflectance values between 0 and 5000 for band 9. Reflectance values are on the x-axis, and the frequency is on the y-axis. The x-axis limit has been set 5000 in order to better visualize the distribution of reflectance values. We can confirm that the majority of the values are indeed within the 0 to 4000 range.","Histogram of reflectance values between 5000 and 15000 for band 9. Reflectance values are on the x-axis, and the frequency is on the y-axis. Plot shows that a very few number of pixels have reflectance values larger than 5,000. These values are skewing how the image is being rendered and heavily impacting the way the image is drawn on our monitor.")}

# Plot range of reflectance values as a histogram to view range
# and distribution of values.
hist(b9,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta")

# View values between 0 and 5000
hist(b9,breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(0, 5000))
# View higher values
hist(b9, breaks=40,col="darkmagenta",xlim = c(5000, 15000),ylim=c(0,100))

```

As you're examining the histograms above, keep in mind that reflectance values 
range between 0-1. The **data scale factor** in the metadata tells us to divide 
all reflectance values by 10,000. Thus, a value of 5,000 equates to a reflectance 
value of 0.50. Storing data as integers (without decimal places) compared to 
floating points (with decimal places) creates a smaller file. You will see this 
done often when working with remote sensing data. 

Notice in the data that there are some larger reflectance values (>5,000) that 
represent a smaller number of pixels. These pixels are skewing how the image 
renders. 

### Data Ignore Value
Image data in raster 
format will often contain a data ignore value and a scale factor. The data ignore 
value represents pixels where there are no data. Among other causes, no data 
values may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the 
image or to processing results which yield null values. 

Remember that the metadata for the `Reflectance` dataset designated -9999 as 
`data ignore value`. Thus, let's set all pixels with a value == -9999 to `NA` 
(no value). If we do this, R won't try to render these pixels.

```{r set-values-NA, fig.cap="Plot of reflectance values for band 9 data with values equal to -9999 set to NA. Image data in raster format will often contain no data values, which may be attributed to the sensor not collecting data in that area of the image or to processing results which yield null values. Reflectance datasets designate -9999 as data ignore values. As such, we will reassign -9999 values to NA so R won't try to render these pixels."}

# there is a no data value in our raster - let's define it
myNoDataValue <- as.numeric(reflInfo$Data_Ignore_Value)
myNoDataValue

# set all values equal to -9999 to NA
b9[b9 == myNoDataValue] <- NA

# plot the image now
image(b9)

```

### Reflectance Values and Image Stretch

Our image still looks dark because R is trying to render all reflectance values 
between 0 and 14999 as if they were distributed equally in the histogram. However 
we know they are not distributed equally. There are many more values between 
0-5000 then there are values >5000. 

Images have a distribution of reflectance values. A typical image viewing program 
will render the values by distributing the entire range of reflectance values  
across a range of "shades" that the monitor can render - between 0 and 255. 
However, often the distribution of reflectance values is not linear. For example, 
in the case of our data, most of the reflectance values fall between 0 and 0.5. 
Yet there are a few values >0.8 that are heavily impacting the way the image is 
drawn on our monitor. Imaging processing programs like ENVI, QGIS and ArcGIS (and 
even Adobe Photoshop) allow you to adjust the stretch of the image. This is similar 
to adjusting the contrast and brightness in Photoshop. 

The proper way to adjust our data would be 
what's called an `image stretch`. We will learn how to stretch our image data, 
later. For now, let's plot the values as the log function on the pixel 
reflectance values to factor out those larger values. 

```{r plot-log, fig.cap="Plot of log transformed reflectance values for the previous b9 image. Applying the log to the image increases the contrast making it look more like an image by factoring out those larger values. While an improvement, the image is still far from great. The proper way to adjust an image is by doing whats called an image stretch." }

image(log(b9))

```

The log applied to our image increases the contrast making it look more like an 
image. However, look at the images below. The top one is what our log adjusted 
image looks like when plotted. The bottom on is an RGB version of the same image. 
Notice a difference?

    <figcaption>TOP: The image as it should look. BOTTOM: the image that we outputted from the code above. Notice a difference?</figcaption>


### Transpose Image

Notice that there are three data dimensions for this file: Bands x Rows x 
Columns. However, when R reads in the dataset, it reads them as: Columns x 
Bands x Rows. The data are flipped. We can quickly transpose the data to correct 
for this using the `t` or `transpose` command in R.

The orientation is rotated in our log adjusted image. This is because R reads 
in matrices starting from the upper left hand corner. Whereas, most rasters 
read pixels starting from the lower left hand corner. In the next section, we 
will deal with this issue by creating a proper georeferenced (spatially located) 
raster in R. The raster format will read in pixels following the same methods 
as other GIS and imaging processing software like QGIS and ENVI do.

```{r transpose-data, fig.cap="Plot showing the transposed image of the log transformed reflectance values of b9. The orientation of the image is rotated in our log transformed image, because R reads in the matrices starting from the upper left hand corner."}

# We need to transpose x and y values in order for our 
# final image to plot properly
b9 <- t(b9)
image(log(b9), main="Transposed Image")
```


## Create a Georeferenced Raster

Next, we will create a proper raster using the `b9` matrix. The raster 
format will allow us to define and manage:

* Image stretch
* Coordinate reference system & spatial reference
* Resolution
* and other raster attributes...

It will also account for the orientation issue discussed above.
 
To create a raster in R, we need a few pieces of information, including: 

* The coordinate reference system (CRS)
* The spatial extent of the image 


### Define Raster CRS

First, we need to define the Coordinate reference system (CRS) of the raster. 
To do that, we can first grab the EPSG code from the HDF5 attributes, and covert the
EPSG to a CRS string. Then we can assign that CRS to the raster object.

```{r define-CRS, fig.cap="Plot of the properly oriented raster image of the band 9 data. In order to orient the image correctly, the coordinate reference system was defined and assigned to the raster object. X-axis represents the UTM Easting values, and the Y-axis represents the Northing values."}

# Extract the EPSG from the h5 dataset
myEPSG <- h5read(f, "/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/EPSG Code")

# convert the EPSG code to a CRS string
myCRS <- crs(paste0("+init=epsg:",myEPSG))

# define final raster with projection info 
# note that capitalization will throw errors on a MAC.
# if UTM is all caps it might cause an error!
b9r <- raster(b9, 
        crs=myCRS)

# view the raster attributes
b9r

# let's have a look at our properly oriented raster. Take note of the 
# coordinates on the x and y axis.

image(log(b9r), 
      xlab = "UTM Easting", 
      ylab = "UTM Northing",
      main = "Properly Oriented Raster")


```

Next we define the extents of our raster. The extents will be used to calculate 
the raster's resolution. Fortunately, the spatial extent is provided in the
HDF5 file "Reflectance_Data" group attributes that we saved before as `reflInfo`.

```{r define-extent}
# Grab the UTM coordinates of the spatial extent
xMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]
xMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[2]
yMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]
yMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[4]

# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)
rasExt

# assign the spatial extent to the raster
extent(b9r) <- rasExt

# look at raster attributes
b9r

```

		Observatory Network (NEON) 

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/raster-data-series" target="_blank"> Learn more about raster attributes including extent, and coordinate reference systems here.</a>

We can adjust the colors of our raster too if we want.

```{r  plot-colors-raster, fig.cap="Plot of the properly oriented raster image of B9 with custom colors. We can adjust the colors of the image by adjusting the z limits, which in this case makes the highly reflective surfaces more vibrant. This color adjustment is more apparent in the bottom left of the image, where the parking lot, buildings and bare surfaces are located. X-axis represents the UTM Easting values, and the Y-axis represents the Northing values."}

# let's change the colors of our raster and adjust the zlims 
col <- terrain.colors(25)

image(b9r,  
      xlab = "UTM Easting", 
      ylab = "UTM Northing",
      main= "Raster w Custom Colors",
      col=col, 
      zlim=c(0,3000))

```


We've now created a raster from band 9 reflectance data. We can export the data
as a raster, using the `writeRaster` command. 

```{r  write-raster,  eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# write out the raster as a geotiff
writeRaster(b9r,
            file=paste0(wd,"band9.tif"),
            format="GTiff",
            overwrite=TRUE)

# It's always good practice to close the H5 connection before moving on!
# close the H5 file
H5close()

```




### Challenge: Work with Rasters

Try these three extensions on your own: 

1. Create rasters using other bands in the dataset.

2. Vary the distribution of values in the image to mimic an image stretch. 
e.g. `b9[b9 > 6000 ] <- 6000`

3. Use what you know to extract ALL of the reflectance values for
ONE pixel rather than for an entire band. HINT: this will require you to pick
an x and y value and then all values in the z dimension:
`aPixel<- h5read(f,"Reflectance",index=list(NULL,100,35))`. Plot the spectra 
output.

## Introduction to Structural Diversity Metrics

Forest structure influences many important ecological processes, including:

  + biogeochemical cycling, 
  + wildfires, 
  + species richness and diversity, 
  + and many others. 
  
Quantifying forest structure, hereafter referred to as "*structural 
diversity*," presents a challenge for many reasons, including difficulty in 
measuring individual trees, limbs, and leaves across large areas. In order 
to overcome this challenge, today's researchers use Light Detection And 
Ranging (LiDAR) technology to measure large areas of forest. It is also 
challenging to calculate meaningful summary metrics of a forest's structure 
that 1) are ecologically relevant and 2) can be used to compare different 
forested locations. In this tutorial, you will be introduced to a few tools 
that will help you to explore and quantify forest structure using LiDAR data 
collected at two field sites of the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> 
National Ecological Observatory Network</a>. 

## NEON AOP Discrete Return LIDAR
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank"> The NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) </a>. 
has several sensors including discrete-return LiDAR, which is useful for measuring forest structural diversity that can be summarized into four categories of metrics: (1) canopy height, (2) canopy cover and openness, and (3) canopy heterogeneity (internal and external), and (4) vegetation area.

We will be comparing the structural diversity of two NEON sites that vary in their structural characteristics. 

First, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">Harvard Forest (HARV)</a>, which is located in Massachusetts. It is a lower elevation, mixed deciduous and evergreen forest dominated by Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Aralia nudicaulis.

Second, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle (TEAK)</a>, which is a high elevation forested NEON site in California. TEAK is an evergreen forest dominated by Abies magnifica, Abies concolor, Pinus jeffreyi, and Pinus contorta. 

As you can imagine, these two forest types will have both similarities and differences in their structural attributes. We can quantify these attributes by calculating several different structural diversity metrics, and comparing 
the results.

### Loading the LIDAR Products
To begin, we first need to load our required R packages, and set our working 
directory to the location where we saved the input LiDAR .laz files that can be 
downloaded from the NEON Data Portal.

```{r, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(lidR)
library(gstat)
library(data.table)
library(kableExtra)
```

Next, we will read in the LiDAR data using the `lidR::readLAS()` function. 
Note that this function can read in both `.las` and `.laz` file formats.

```{r}

# Read in LiDAR data 
#2017 1 km2 tile .laz file type for HARV and TEAK

#Watch out for outlier Z points - this function also allows for the
#ability to filter outlier points well above or below the landscape
#(-drop_z_blow and -drop_z_above). See how we have done this here 
#for you.

HARV <- lidR::readLAS('/Users/rohan/Environmental-Informatics-Using-Research-Infrastructures-and-their-Data/data/NEON_D01_HARV_DP1_727000_4702000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz',filter = "-drop_z_below 150 -drop_z_above 325")

TEAK <- lidR::readLAS('/Users/rohan/Environmental-Informatics-Using-Research-Infrastructures-and-their-Data/data/NEON_D17_TEAK_DP1_316000_4091000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz',filter = "-drop_z_below 1694 -drop_z_above 2500")


```

Let's check out: 

  1. the extent, 
  2. coordinate system, 
  3. and a 3D plot of each .laz file.

XQuartz for 3D plots - see xquartz.org*

### Normalizing Tree Height to Ground
To begin, we will take a look at the structural diversity of the dense mixed deciduous/evergreen 
forest of HARV. We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent for our analysis, but first we 
need to normalize the height values of this LiDAR point cloud from an absolute elevation 
above mean sea level to height above the ground using the `lidR::normalize_height()` function. 

This function relies on spatial interpolation, and therefore we want to perform this step on an area 
that is quite a bit larger than our area of interest to avoid edge effects. 

To be safe, we will clip out an area of 200 x 200 m, normalize it, and then clip out our smaller area of interest.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Correct for elevation 
#We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent, which is the
#extent for NEON base plots. 
#First set the center of where you want the plot to be (note easting 
#and northing works in units of m because these data are in a UTM 
#proejction as shown in the summary above).
x <- 727500 #easting 
y <- 4702500 #northing

#Cut out a 200 x 200 m buffer by adding 100 m to easting and 
#northing coordinates (x,y).
data.200m <- 
   clip_rectangle(HARV,
                    xleft = (x - 100), ybottom = (y - 100),
                    xright = (x + 100), ytop = (y + 100))

#Correct for ground height using a kriging function to interpolate 
#elevation from ground points in the .laz file.
#If the function will not run, then you may need to checkfor outliers
#by adjusting the 'drop_z_' arguments when reading in the .laz files.
dtm <- grid_terrain(data.200m, 1, kriging(k = 10L))
data.200m <- normalize_height(data.200m, dtm)

#Will often give a warning if not all points could be corrected, 
#but visually check to see if it corrected for ground height. 
lidR::plot(data.200m)
#There's only a few uncorrected points and we'll fix these in 
#the next step. 

#Clip 20 m out from each side of the easting and northing 
#coordinates (x,y).
data.40m <- 
   clip_rectangle(data.200m, 
                    xleft = (x - 20), ybottom = (y - 20),
                    xright = (x + 20), ytop = (y + 20))

data.40m@data$Z[data.40m@data$Z <= .5] <- NA  
#This line filters out all z_vals below .5 m as we are less 
#interested in shrubs/trees. 
#You could change it to zero or another height depending on interests. 

#visualize the clipped plot point cloud
lidR::plot(data.40m) 
```

>40 meter by 40 meter point cloud from Harvard Forest showing a cross-section of the forest structure with a complex canopy- and sub-canopy structure with many rounded crowns, characteristic of a deciduous-dominated section of forest.

## Calculating Structural Diversity Metrics
Now that we have our area of interest normalized and clipped, we can proceed with calculating 
our structural diversity metrics. 

### GENERATE CANOPY HEIGHT MODEL (CHM) 
(i.e. a 1 m2 raster grid of vegetations heights)

```{r calculate-structural-diversity-metrics, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Canopy Height Model (CHM) of HARV study area"}

# Structural diversity metrics


#res argument specifies pixel size in meters and dsmtin is 
#for raster interpolation
chm <- grid_canopy(data.40m, res = 1, dsmtin())  

#visualize CHM
lidR::plot(chm) 

```

#### MEAN OUTER CANOPY HEIGHT (MOCH)

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#calculate MOCH, the mean CHM height value
mean.max.canopy.ht <- mean(chm@data@values, na.rm = TRUE) 
```
#### MAX CANOPY HEIGHT

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#calculate HMAX, the maximum CHM height value
max.canopy.ht <- max(chm@data@values, na.rm=TRUE) 
```

#### RUMPLE
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#calculate rumple, a ratio of outer canopy surface area to 
#ground surface area (1600 m^2)
rumple <- rumple_index(chm) 

```

#### TOP RUGOSITY

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#top rugosity, the standard deviation of pixel values in chm and 
#is a measure of outer canopy roughness
top.rugosity <- sd(chm@data@values, na.rm = TRUE) 
```

#### DEEP GAPS & DEEP GAP FRACTION
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#number of cells in raster (also area in m2)
cells <- length(chm@data@values) 
chm.0 <- chm
chm.0[is.na(chm.0)] <- 0 #replace NAs with zeros in CHM
#create variable for the number of deep gaps, 1 m^2 canopy gaps
zeros <- which(chm.0@data@values == 0) 
deepgaps <- length(zeros) #number of deep gaps
#deep gap fraction, the number of deep gaps in the chm relative 
#to total number of chm pixels
deepgap.fraction <- deepgaps/cells 

```
#### COVER FRACTION
```{r, eval=FALSE}

#cover fraction, the inverse of deep gap fraction
cover.fraction <- 1 - deepgap.fraction 
```
#### HEIGHT SD
The standard deviation of height values for all points in the plot point cloud
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#height SD, the standard deviation of height values for all points
#in the plot point cloud
vert.sd <- cloud_metrics(data.40m, sd(Z, na.rm = TRUE)) 


#SD of VERTICAL SD of HEIGHT
#rasterize plot point cloud and calculate the standard deviation 
#of height values at a resolution of 1 m^2
sd.1m2 <- grid_metrics(data.40m, sd(Z), 1)
#standard deviation of the calculated standard deviations 
#from previous line 
#This is a measure of internal and external canopy complexity
sd.sd <- sd(sd.1m2[,3], na.rm = TRUE) 


#some of the next few functions won't handle NAs, so we need 
#to filter these out of a vector of Z points
Zs <- data.40m@data$Z
Zs <- Zs[!is.na(Zs)]
```
#### ENTROPY
Quantifies diversity & evenness of point cloud heights
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#by = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m tall horizontal slices 
#ranges from 0-1, with 1 being more evenly distributed points 
#across the 1 m tall slices 
entro <- entropy(Zs, by = 1) 
```

#### GAP FRACTION PROFILE 
Gap fraction profile, assesses the distribution of gaps in the canopy volume
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#dz = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m horizontal slices 
#z0 is set to a reasonable height based on the age and height of 
#the study sites 
gap_frac <- gap_fraction_profile(Zs, dz = 1, z0=3) 
#defines gap fraction profile as the average gap fraction in each 
#1 m horizontal slice assessed in the previous line
GFP.AOP <- mean(gap_frac$gf) 
```

#### VAI
Leaf area density, assesses leaf area in the canopy volume
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 
#k = 0.5 is a standard extinction coefficient for foliage 
#dz = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m horizontal slices 
#z0 is set to the same height as gap fraction profile above
LADen<-LAD(Zs, dz = 1, k=0.5, z0=3) 
#vegetation area index, sum of leaf area density values for 
#all horizontal slices assessed in previous line
VAI.AOP <- sum(LADen$lad, na.rm=TRUE) 
```

#### VCI
A vertical complexity index, fixed normalization of entropy metric calculated above
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#set zmax comofortably above maximum canopy height
#by = 1 assesses the metric based on 1 m horizontal slices in 
#the canopy
VCI.AOP <- VCI(Zs, by = 1, zmax=100) 

``` 

We now have 13 different structural diversity metrics.  Let's organize them into a new dataframe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#OUTPUT CALCULATED METRICS INTO A TABLE

### Combining Everything Into One Function
Now that we have run through how to measure each structural diversity metric, let's create a 
convenient function to run these a little faster on the TEAK site for a comparison of structural 
diversity with HARV. 

```{r calculate-structural-diversity-metrics-TEAK, eval=FALSE}
#Let's correct for elevation and measure structural diversity for TEAK
x <- 316400 
y <- 4091700

data.200m <- clip_rectangle(TEAK, 
                              xleft = (x - 100), ybottom = (y - 100),
                              xright = (x + 100), ytop = (y + 100))

dtm <- grid_terrain(data.200m, 1, kriging(k = 10L))
data.200m <- normalize_height(data.200m, dtm)

data.40m <- clip_rectangle(data.200m, 
                             xleft = (x - 20), ybottom = (y - 20),
                             xright = (x + 20), ytop = (y + 20))
data.40m@data$Z[data.40m@data$Z <= .5] <- 0  
plot(data.40m)
```

```{r structural-diversity-function, eval=FALSE}

#Zip up all the code we previously used and write function to

   print(out.plot)
}

TEAK_structural_diversity <- structural_diversity_metrics(data.40m)

```

### Comparing Metrics Between Forests
How does the structural diversity of the evergreen TEAK forest compare to the mixed deciduous/evergreen forest from HARV? Let's combine the result data.frames for a direct comparison:

```{r combine results, eval=FALSE}

combined_results=rbind(HARV_structural_diversity, 
                       TEAK_structural_diversity)

# Add row names for clarity
row.names(combined_results)=c("HARV","TEAK")

# Take a look to compare
combined_results

```



## Matching GEDI waveforms with NEON AOP LiDAR pointclouds

>author: Donal O'Leary

*GEDI has amazing coverage around the globe, but is limited in its spatial resolution. Here, we extract NEON pointcloud data corresponding to individual GEDI waveforms to better understand how the GEDI return waveform gets its shape.*

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1">

### Learning Objectives 
After completing this section you will be able to: 

* Search for GEDI data based on a NEON site bounding box
* Extract NEON LiDAR pointcloud data corresponding to a specific GEDI footprint
* Visualize NEON and GEDI LiDAR data together in 3D

### Things You’ll Need To Complete This GEDI Section

### Getting Started
In this section we will compare NEON and GEDI LiDAR data by comparing the information that they both capture in the same location. NEON data are actually one of the datasets used by the GEDI mission to calibrate and validate GEDI waveforms, so this makes for a valuable comparison! 

In order to compare these data, we will need to download GEDI data that overlap a NEON site. Fortunately, Carlos Silva et al. have made a convenient R package clled `rGEDI` and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rGEDI/vignettes/tutorial.html">this excellent tutorial hosted on CRAN</a> desribing how to work with GEDI data in R. 

However, GEDI data are currently only available to download per complete orbit, which means that the vast majority of the orbit's data does not fall within a NEON site. The GEDI orbit datasets come in HDF5 data format, and contain about 7Gb of data, so you may want to run the first few sections of this tutorial to get the GEDI download started, and refresh your memory of HDF5 files with NEON's <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hdf5-r-series">Intro to HDF5 series</a>.

First, we will load the required libraries and set our working directory:

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE}
# devtools::install_git("https://github.com/carlos-alberto-silva/rGEDI", dependencies = TRUE)
library(rGEDI)
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(sf)
library(rgl)
library(lidR)
library(neonUtilities)
library(viridis)
library(maptools)

#wd <- "./data" # This will depend on your local environment
#setwd(wd)

```

Next, we will download a Canopy Height Model (CHM) tile from the Wind River Experiemental Forest (WREF) using the `byTileAOP()` function to use as a preliminary map on which to overlay the GEDI data. There is one particularly interesting mosaic tile which we will select using the `easting` and `northing` arguments. We then load the raster into R and make a simple plot. For more information about CHMs, please see our tutorial <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/chm-dsm-dtm-gridded-lidar-data">What is a CHM?</a>

```{r download-chm, message=FALSE}

# Define the SITECODE as a variable because
# we will use it several times in this tutorial
SITECODE <- "WREF"

byTileAOP(dpID = "DP3.30015.001", site = SITECODE, year = 2017, 
          easting = 580000, northing = 5075000, check.size = F,
          savepath = './data')

chm <- raster('./data/DP3.30015.001/neon-aop-products/2017/FullSite/D16/2017_WREF_1/L3/DiscreteLidar/CanopyHeightModelGtif/NEON_D16_WREF_DP3_580000_5075000_CHM.tif')

plot(chm)

```

As you can see, this particular CHM is showing a conspicuous, triangle-shaped clearcut in this section of the experimental forest, where the tree canopy is much shorter than the towering 60m+ trees in the undisturbed areas. This variation will give us a variety of forest structures to investigate.

### Downloading GEDI data
This next section on downloading and working with GEDI data is loosely based on the excellent `rGEDI` package tutorial <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rGEDI/vignettes/tutorial.html">posted on CRAN here</a>. If you would prefer to avoid a large download (>7Gb) of a full GEDI orbit, you can forego these steps and use the <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24978809">
example GEDI dataset here</a>, and skip to the `readLevel1B()` function below.

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a NASA mission with the primary data collection being performed by a novel waveform lidar instrument mounted on the International Space Station (ISS). Please see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666017220300018">this open-access paper</a> published in Science of Remote Sensing that describes this mission in detail. The ISS orbits around the world every 90 minutes, and can be tracked <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm">on this cool NASA website</a>. 

As described <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/gedi-overview/">here</a> on the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), "the sole GEDI observable is the waveform from which all other data products are derived. Each waveform is captured with a nominal ~30 m diameter." As of the date of publication, GEDI data are only offered in HDF5 format, with each file containing the data for a full orbit. The LP DAAC has developed a tool that allows researchers to input a bounding box, which will return a list of every orbit that has a "shot" (waveform return) that falls within that box. Unfortunately, at this time, the tool will not subset out the specific shots that fall within that bounding box; you must download the entire orbit (~7Gb). This functionality may be improved in the future.

Our next few steps involve defining our bounding box, requesting the list of GEDI orbits that contain data relevant to that bounding box, and downloading those data. Let's focus on the extent of our CHM that we downloaded above - but we will first need to re-project the CHM from its UTM projection into WGS84. To do so, we will refer to the EPSG code for WGS84. To look up any of these codes, please see the amazing resource <a href="https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/">spatialrerference.org</a>.

```{r project-CHM}

# Project CHM to WGS84
chm_WGS = projectRaster(chm, crs=CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))

# Study area boundary box coordinates
ul_lat<- extent(chm_WGS)[4]
lr_lat<- extent(chm_WGS)[3]
ul_lon<- extent(chm_WGS)[1]
lr_lon<- extent(chm_WGS)[2]

```

Next, we use that bounding box information as an input to the `gedifinder()` funciton.

```{r find-GEDI-orbits, eval=FALSE}

# Specifying the optional date range, if desired
daterange=c("2019-03-25", #first date of GEDI availability
           "2020-07-15")

# Get path to GEDI data
# These lines use an API request to determine which orbits are available 
# that intersect the bounding box of interest.
# Note that you still must download the entire orbit and then subset to 
# your area of interest!
gLevel1B <- gedifinder(product="GEDI01_B",
                      ul_lat, ul_lon, lr_lat,lr_lon,
                     version="001",daterange=NULL)
# 
# # View list of available data
 gLevel1B

```

Great! There are several GEDI orbits available that have at least 1 'shot' within our bounding box of interest. For more information about GEDI filename conventions, and other valuable information about GEDI data, <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/gedi-overview/#gedi-temporal-and-spatial-resolution">see this page on the LP DAAC</a>. However, as mentioned before, each of these files are quite large (~7Gb), so let's focus on just the first one for now.

```{r download-GEDI, eval=F, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}

# Downloading GEDI data, if you haven't already
# Note that this will download a large file (>7Gb) which
# can be avoided by using the example dataset provided above.
# wd='./data/'
# if(!file.exists(paste0("./data/",basename(gLevel1B[2])))){
#   gediDownload(filepath=gLevel1B[2],outdir="./data/")
# }

```

Next, we use the rGEDI package to read in the GEDI data. First, we need to make a 'gedi.level1b' object using the `readLevel1B()` function. Next, we extract the geographic position of the center of each shot from the 'gedi.level1b' object using the `getLevel1BGeo()` function, and display the head of the resulting table.

From this point on, we will be using the (much smaller) example subset of GEDI data linked at the top of this section. All functions and processes should also work with a full GEDI dataset downloaded above, if you choose to pursue this research on your own!

```{r read-GEDI, message=F, eval=FALSE}

gedilevel1b<-readLevel1B(level1Bpath = file.path('./data/NEON_WREF_GEDI_subset.h5'))
#gedilevel1b<-readLevel1B(level1Bpath = file.path(wd, "GEDI01_B_2019206022612_O03482_T00370_02_003_01.h5"))
level1bGeo<-getLevel1BGeo(level1b=gedilevel1b,select=c("elevation_bin0"))
head(level1bGeo)

```

### Plot GEDI footprints on CHM
Let's visualize where the GEDI footprints are located on the CHM tile. To do so, we will need to first convert the GEDI data into a spatial object. For this example, we will use a 'spatial features' object type from the 'sp' package:

```{r GEDI-spatial-df, eval=FALSE}

# drop any shots with missing latitude/longitude values
level1bGeo = level1bGeo[!is.na(level1bGeo$latitude_bin0)&
                          !is.na(level1bGeo$longitude_bin0),]

# Convert the GEDI data.frame into an 'sf' object
level1bGeo_spdf<-st_as_sf(level1bGeo, 
                          coords = c("longitude_bin0", "latitude_bin0"),
                          crs=CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))


# crop to the CHM that is in WGS84
level1bgeo_WREF=st_crop(level1bGeo_spdf, chm_WGS)

```

Next, project the GEDI geospatial data into the UTM zone that the CHM is within (Zone 10 North). These data come as the point location at the center of the GEDI footprint, so we next convert the GEDI footprint center (lat/long) into a circle using the `buffer()` function. Finally, we can plot the CHM and overlay the GEDI footprint circles, and label with the last three digits of the 'shot' number.

```{r overly-GEDI-on-chm, warning=F, eval=FALSE}

# project to UTM
level1bgeo_WREF_UTM=st_transform(
  level1bgeo_WREF, crs=chm$NEON_D16_WREF_DP3_580000_5075000_CHM@crs)

# buffer the GEDI shot center by a radius of 12.5m 
# to represent the full 25m diameter GEDI footprint
level1bgeo_WREF_UTM_buffer=st_buffer(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM, dist=12.5)

# plot CHM and overlay GEDI data
plot(chm)
plot(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM_buffer, add=T, col="transparent")

# add labes with the last three digits of the GEDI shot_number
pointLabel(st_coordinates(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM),
           labels=level1bgeo_WREF_UTM$shot_number, cex=1)


```

### Extract Waveform for a single Shot
Let's take a look at a waveform for a single GEDI shot. We can select a shot by using its `shot_number` as shown below. Note, however, that the example data subset shots have been re-numbered, and those numbers will not correspond with full orbit GEDI data.

```{r extract-wf, warning=F, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Extracting GEDI full-waveform for a given shot_number
wf <- getLevel1BWF(gedilevel1b,shot_number = 20)

# or, if using a full GEDI dataset,
# wf <- getLevel1BWF(gedilevel1b,shot_number = level1bgeo_WREF_UTM_buffer$shot_number[which(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM_buffer$shot_number==1786)])

# Save current plotting parameters to revert to
oldpar <- par()

# Set up plotting paramters
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar=c(4,4,1,1), cex.axis = 1.5)

# Plot filled-in waveform 
plot(wf, relative=FALSE, polygon=TRUE, type="l", lwd=2, col="forestgreen",
     xlab="Waveform Amplitude", ylab="Elevation (m)")
grid() #add a grid to the plot

# Plot a simple line with no fill
plot(wf, relative=TRUE, polygon=FALSE, type="l", lwd=2, col="forestgreen",
     xlab="Waveform Amplitude (%)", ylab="Elevation (m)")
grid()#add a grid to the plot

# Revert plotting parameters to previous values.
par(oldpar)

```

This waveform shows some noise above and below the main ecosystem return, with a fairly dense canopy around 370m elevation, and a characteristic ground return spike at about 340m. While the GEDI data are extremely valuable and offer a near-global coverage, it is hard to get a good sense of what the ecosystem really looks like from this GEDI waveform. Let's download some NEON AOP pointcloud data to pair up with this waveform to get a better sense of what GEDI is reporting.

### Download and Plot NEON AOP LiDAR pointcloud data
Here, we will use the `byTileAOP()` function from the 'neonUtilities' package to download the classified pointcloud mosaic data (DP1.30003.001). Since this is a mosaic tile like the CHM, we can just pass this function the lower left corner of the CHM tile to get the corresponding lidar pointcloud mosaic tile for our analysis.

```{r download-AOP-lidar, eval=FALSE}

# Download the pointcloud data if you don't have it already
if (!file.exists('./data/DP1.30003.001/2017/FullSite/D16/2017_WREF_1/L1/DiscreteLidar/ClassifiedPointCloud/NEON_D16_WREF_DP1_580000_5075000_classified_point_cloud.laz')){
  byTileAOP(dpID = "DP1.30003.001", site = SITECODE, year = 2017, 
          easting = extent(chm)[1], northing=extent(chm)[3], 
          check.size = F, savepath = './data/') # Edit savepath as needed
}

```

After downloading the point cloud data, let's read them into our R session using the `readLAS()` function from the `lidaR` package, and plot them in 3D. Note, you may need to update your 'XQuartz' if you are using a Mac.

```{r plot-lidar-pointcloud-bad, eval=FALSE}

WREF_LAS=readLAS("./data/DP1.30003.001/2017/FullSite/D16/2017_WREF_1/L1/DiscreteLidar/ClassifiedPointCloud/NEON_D16_WREF_DP1_580000_5075000_classified_point_cloud.laz")

lidR::plot(WREF_LAS)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/GEDI_AOP1.png')
```
Oh, yikes! There are a lot of outliers above the actual forest, and a few below. Let's use some simple statistics to throw out those outliers. We will first calculate the mean and standard deviation for the verical axis, and then use the 'filter' options of the `readLAS()` function to eliminate the vertical outliers.

```{r plot-lidar-pointcloud-good, eval=FALSE}

# ### remove outlier lidar point outliers using mean and sd statistics
Z_sd=sd(WREF_LAS@data$Z)
Z_mean=mean(WREF_LAS@data$Z)
 
# make filter string in form filter = "-drop_z_below 50 -drop_z_above 1000"
# You can increase or decrease (from 4) the number of sd's to filter outliers
f = paste("-drop_z_below",(Z_mean-4*Z_sd),"-drop_z_above",(Z_mean+4*Z_sd))

# Read in LAS file, trimming off vertical outlier points
WREF_LAS=readLAS("./data/DP1.30003.001/2017/FullSite/D16/2017_WREF_1/L1/DiscreteLidar/ClassifiedPointCloud/NEON_D16_WREF_DP1_580000_5075000_classified_point_cloud.laz",
                 filter = f)

#Plot the full LiDAR point cloud mosaic tile (1km^2)
plot(WREF_LAS)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/GEDI_AOP2.png')
```

Ahhh, that's better.

### Clip AOP LiDAR Pointcloud to GEDI footprints
We can now use the GEDI footprint circles (that we made using the `buffer()` function) to clip out the NEON AOP LiDAR points that correspond with the GEDI footprints:

```{r clip-AOP-to-GEDI, eval=FALSE}

# Clip the pointcloud by the GEDI footprints created by buffering above. 
# This makes a 'list' of LAS objects
WREF_GEDI_footprints=lasclip(WREF_LAS, geometry = level1bgeo_WREF_UTM_buffer)

# we can now plot individual footprint clips
plot(WREF_GEDI_footprints[[8]])

```

### Plot GEDI Waveform with AOP Pointcloud in 3D space
Now that we can extract individual waveforms, and the AOP LiDAR pointcloud that corresponds with each GEDI waveform, let's see if we can plot them both in 3D space. We already know how to plot the AOP LiDAR points, so let's write a function to draw the GEDI waveform, too, using the `points3d()` function:

```{r plot-lidar-together-1, eval=FALSE}

for(shot_n in c(20)){

  # First, plot the NEON AOP LiDAR clipped to the GEDI footprint
  # We save the plot as an object 'p' which gives the (x,y) offset for the lower
  # left corner of the plot. The 'rgl' package offsets all (x,y) locations 
  # to this point, so we will need to subtract these values from any other 
  # (x,y) points that we want to add to the plot
  p=plot(WREF_GEDI_footprints[[shot_n]])
  
  # Extract the specific waveform from the GEDI data
  wf <- getLevel1BWF(gedilevel1b,shot_number = level1bgeo_WREF$shot_number[shot_n])
  
  # Make a new data.frame 'd' to convert the waveform data coordinates into 3D space
  d=wf@dt
  
  # normalize rxwaveform to 0-1
  d$rxwaveform=d$rxwaveform-min(d$rxwaveform)
  d$rxwaveform=d$rxwaveform/max(d$rxwaveform)
  
  # Add xy data in UTMs, and offset lower left corner of 'p'
  d$x=st_coordinates(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM[shot_n,])[1]-p[1]
  d$y=st_coordinates(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM[shot_n,])[2]-p[2]
  
  # Make a new column 'x_wf' where we place the GEDI waveform in space with the

Whoa, it looks like there is a bad vertical mismatch between those two data sources. This is because the two data sources have a different vertical datum. The NEON AOP data are delivered in the GEOID12A datum, while the GEDI data are delivered in the WGS84 native datum. We will need to convert one to the other to get them to line up correctly.

### Datum, Geoid, and how to best measure the Earth
We are seeing a vertical mismatch between the NEON and GEDI LiDAR data sources because they are using different standards for measuring the Earth. Here, we will briefly describe the main differences between these two datum models, and then show how to correct for this discrepancy.

#### WGS84
As described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">this great Wikipedia article</a> the World Geodedic System (WGS) is a global standard for cartography, geodesy, and navigation including GPS. Most people refer to "WGS84," which is the latest revision to this system in 1984. To describe elevation, WGS84 uses an idealized mathematical model to describe the 'oblate spheroid' of the Earth (basically, it looks kind of like a sphere that is wider around the equator and shorter from pole to pole). This model, called a 'datum,' defines the relative elevational surface of the Earth. However, the Earth isn't exactly this idealized shape - it has a lot of undulations caused by topogrophy and local differences in its gravitational field. In the locations where the natural variations of the Earth do not coencide with the mathematical model, it can be harder to accurately describe the elevation of certain landforms and structures. Still, for a global datum, WGS84 does a great job overall.

#### GEOID12A
While WGS84 is a convenient global standard, precisely describing location information is a common problem in geography, and is often remedied by using a local datum or projection. For latitude and longitude spatial information in North America, this is often done by using the <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/datums/horizontal/north-american-datum-1983.shtml">North American Datum (NAD83)</a> or various Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or State Plane projections based on the NAD83 datum. The NAD83 Datum was developed in 1983 as the horizontal and geometric control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. This is the official datum for the government of the United States of America, and therefore many public datasets that are specific to this geographic region use this datum. In order to further refine the vertical precision over a wide geographic area, we can model the gravitational field of the Earth - this surface is called a "Geoid". <a href="https://geodesy.noaa.gov/GEOID/geoid_def.html">According to NOAA</a>, a geoid can be defined as "the equipotential surface of the Earth’s gravity field which best fits, in a least squares sense, global mean sea level." For a nice description of the North American geoid, please <a href="https://geodesy.noaa.gov/GEOID/geophysics.shtml">see this page on the NOAA website</a> written by Dr. Allen Joel Anderson. As described by Dr. Anderson, this gravitational field is changing all the time, as can global mean sea level (due to melting glaciers, etc.). Therefore local and regional geoids must be updated regularly to reflect these changes, as shown <a href="https://geodesy.noaa.gov/GEOID/models.shtml">in this list of NOAA geoids</a>. One recent standard from 2012 is <<a href="https://geodesy.noaa.gov/GEOID/GEOID12A/">GEOID12A</a> - this is the geoid selected by NEON as the vertical reference for the Z-dimension of our LiDAR data. Note that GEOID12B superscedes GEOID12A, however they are identical everywhere except for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands <a href="https://geodesy.noaa.gov/GEOID/GEOID12B/">according to NOAA</a>. If you are working with any NEON data from Puerto Rico, please be aware that these data are delivered in GEOID12A format and may need to be converted to GEOID12B for some purposes.

For more information about these standards, please see <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/about-the-geoid-ellipsoid-spheroid-and-datum-and-h.htm">this ESRI help document</a>.

### Aligning the Vertical Datum
AOP data have a relatively small area of coverage, and are therefore delivered with the coordinate reference system (CRS) in the UTM zone in which they were collected, set to the GEOID12A vertical datum (roughly equaling mean sea level). Meanwhile, GEDI data are global, so they are delivered with the common WGS84 ellipsoidal refrence datum. We need to align these vertical datums to ensure that the two data products line up correctly. However, this is not a trivial step, nor as simple as a reprojection. In this example, we will keep the NEON LiDAR data in its current datum, and convert the vertical position of the GEDI data from WGS84 into GEOID12A vertical position.

NOAA has a useful <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/facts/vdatum.shtml">tool called Vdatum</a> that will convert from one datum to another. For this example, we will use Vdatum to convert from WGS84 to NAD83. Seeing as GEOID12A is based on the NAD83 datum, we can first convert the GEDI data's vertical position from WGS84 to NAD83 datum, then apply the offset between NAD83 and GEOID12A. Rather than use the Vdatum tool for each point, we will use a raster created by NEON scientists that reports the vertical difference between WGS84 and NAD83 for all points in the conterminous USA.

You can access this dataset by <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24994703">clicking here to download the WGS84-NAD83 datum offset raster</a>.

### GEOID12A Height Model
GEOID12A is a surface model that is described in terms of its relative height compared to NAD83. You can use <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/GEOID_STUFF/geoid12A_prompt1.prl">this interactive webpage</a> to find the geoid height for any location within North America. However, that would be combersome to have to use this webpage for every location. Instead, you can download a <a href="https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID/GEOID12A/GEOID12A_CONUS.shtml>binary file from the NOAA website</a> that describes this geoid's height, and convert that into a raster similar to the one that we just downloaded above. To simplify things here, we have already gone through the process of downloading the binary file and converting it to a raster for you to download, which can now easily be read into your R environment.

You can access this dataset by <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24994697">clicking here to download the GEOID12A-NAD83 datum offset raster</a>.


```{r read-in-datum-rasters, eval=FALSE}

GEOID12A_diff_rast=raster("./data/GEOID12A_NAD83_offset.tif")
WGS84_diff_rast=raster("./data/WGS84_NAD83_offset.tif")

```

Now that we have the two offset rasters, let's plot them together to compare their spatial patterns.

```{r plot-both-diff-maps, fig.height=8, fig.width=6, eval=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(2.5,2.5, 3.5,1))
plot(GEOID12A_diff_rast, col=viridis(100),main="GEOID12A minus NAD83 (m)")
plot(WGS84_diff_rast, main="WGS84 minus NAD83 (m)")

```

As you can see, the differences between the GEOID12A geoid, and the NAD83 sphereoid vary quite a lot across space, especially in mountainous areas. The magnitude of these differences is also large, upwards of 35m in some areas. Meanwhile, the differences between the NAD83 and WGS84 sphereoids shows a smooth gradient that is relatively small, with total difference less than 2m across the Conterminous USA. 

### Extract vertical offset for GEDI shots
Now that we know the relative vertical offsets between WGS84, NAD83, and GEOID12A for all of the conterminous USA, we can use the `extract()` function to retrieve those relative offsets for any location. By combining those offsets together, we can finally rectify the vertical position of the NEON and GEDI LiDAR data.

***** DO I need to convert GEDI x/y locations from WGS84 to NAD83?? *****


```{r extract-vert-offsets, eval=FALSE}

# Make a new DF to store the GEDI footprint (x,y) locations, and the relative datum/geoid offsets
footprint_df=as.data.frame(
  cbind(level1bgeo_WREF$longitude_lastbin, level1bgeo_WREF$latitude_lastbin))

WGS_NAD_diff <- extract(WGS84_diff_rast, footprint_df)

GEOID12A_NAD_diff <- extract(GEOID12A_diff_rast,footprint_df)

# Add together the offsets to calculate a vector of net differences in elevation
net_diff=WGS_NAD_diff+GEOID12A_NAD_diff

```


### Plot vertically corrected GEDI waveform in 3D

Now that we have a vertical offset for each of the GEDI footprints, let's try again to plot the NEON AOP pointcloud data with the GEDI waveform.

```{r plot-GEDI-2, eval=FALSE}

# You can enter whichever shots that you want to plot in the for loop here
#for(shot_n in 1:length(WREF_GEDI_footprints)){
for(shot_n in c(20)){

  # First, plot the NEON AOP LiDAR clipped to the GEDI footprint
  # We save the plot as an object 'p' which gives the (x,y) offset for the lower
  # left corner of the plot. The 'rgl' package offsets all (x,y) locations 
  # to this point, so we will need to subtract these values from any other 
  # (x,y) points that we want to add to the plot
  p=plot(WREF_GEDI_footprints[[shot_n]])
  
  # Extract the specific waveform from the GEDI data
  wf <- getLevel1BWF(gedilevel1b,shot_number = level1bgeo_WREF$shot_number[shot_n])
  
  # Make a new data.frame 'd' to convert the waveform data coordinates into 3D space
  d=wf@dt
  
  # normalize rxwaveform to 0-1
  d$rxwaveform=d$rxwaveform-min(d$rxwaveform)
  d$rxwaveform=d$rxwaveform/max(d$rxwaveform)
  
  # Add xy data in UTMs, and offset lower left corner of 'p'
  d$x=st_coordinates(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM[shot_n,])[1]-p[1]
  d$y=st_coordinates(level1bgeo_WREF_UTM[shot_n,])[2]-p[2]
  
  # Make a new column 'x_wf' where we place the GEDI waveform in space with the 
  # NEON AOP LiDAR data, we scale the waveform to 30m in the x-dimension, and 
  # offset by 12.5m (the radius of the GEDI footprint) in the x-dimension.
  d$x_wf=d$x+d$rxwaveform*30+12.5
  
  # Add GEDI points to 3D space in 'green' color
  # This time, subtracting the elevation difference for that shot
  points3d(x=d$x_wf, y=d$y, z=d$elevation-net_diff[shot_n], col="green", add=T)
  
}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/GEDI_AOP3.png')
```

### Optional - NEON base plots
You may also be interested to see if any of the GEDI footprints intersect a NEON base plot, which would allow for a direct comparison of the GEDI waveform with many of the datasets which are collected within the base plots, such as the vegetation structure data product containing height, DBH, and species identification of all trees >10cm DBH. While it is statistically pretty unlikely that a GEDI footprint will intersect with your base plot of interest, it is possible that _some_ GEDI footprint will intersetc with _some_ base plot in your study area, so we may as well take a look:

```{r import and plot base plots}

setwd("./data/") # This will depend upon your local environment

# Download the NEON TOS plots polygons directly from the NEON website
download.file(url="https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/All_NEON_TOS_Plots_V8", 
              destfile="All_NEON_TOS_Plots_V8.zip", mode = 'wb')
unzip("All_NEON_TOS_Plots_V8.zip")
NEON_all_plots <- st_read('All_NEON_TOS_Plots_V8/All_NEON_TOS_Plot_Polygons_V8.shp')

# Select just the WREF site
SITECODE = 'WREF'
base_plots_SPDF <- NEON_all_plots[
  (NEON_all_plots$siteID == SITECODE)&
    (NEON_all_plots$subtype == 'basePlot'),]
rm(NEON_all_plots)

base_crop=st_crop(base_plots_SPDF, extent(chm_WGS))

plot(chm_WGS)
plot(base_crop$geometry, border = 'blue', add=T)

```
