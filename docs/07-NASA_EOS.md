## NASA EOS Earth Data Account:

The EOSDIS Earthdata Login provides a centralized and simplified mechanism for user registration and profile management for all EOSDIS system components. End users may register and edit their profile information in one location allowing them access to the wide array of EOSDIS data and services. The EOSDIS Earthdata Login also helps the EOSDIS program better understand the user demographics and access patterns in support of planning for new value-added features and customized services that can be directed to specific users or user groups resulting in better user experience.

Earthdata Login provides user registration and authentication services and a common set of user information to all EOSDIS data centers in a manner that permits the data center to integrate their additional requirements with the Earthdata Login services. Below is a brief description of services provided by the Earthdata Login.

## The LPDAAC Mission: Process, Archive, Distribute, Apply

The LP DAAC processes, archives, and distributes land data products to hundreds of thousands of users in the earth science community. Land data products are made universally accessible and support the ongoing monitoring of Earth’s land dynamics and environmental systems to facilitate interdisciplinary research, education, and decision-making.

**Process:** Raw data collected from specific satellite sensors, such as ASTER onboard NASA’s Terra satellite, are received and processed into a readable and interpretable format here at the LP DAAC, while other data undergo processing in other facilities around the country before arriving to the LP DAAC to be archived and distributed to the public.

**Archive:** The LP DAAC continually archives a wide variety of land remote sensing data products collected by sensors onboard satellites, aircraft, and the International Space Station (ISS). The archive currently totals more than 3.5 petabytes of data, the equivalent of listening to 800 million songs, and distributes data to over 200,000 global users.

**Distribute:** All data products in the archive are distributed free of charge through NASA [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) and [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) search and download clients. The LP DAAC also supports tools and services, like the [Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AppEEARS)](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/), which allows users to transform and visualize data before download while offering enhanced subsetting and reprojecting capabilities.

## AppEEARS

The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples ([AppEEARS](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/)) offers a simple and efficient way to access and transform [geospatial data](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/products) from a variety of federal data archives in an easy-to-use web application interface. AppEEARS enables users to subset geospatial data spatially, temporally, and by band/layer for point and area samples. AppEEARS returns not only the requested data, but also the associated quality values, and offers interactive visualizations with summary statistics in the web interface. The [AppEEARS API](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/) offers users **programmatic access** to all features available in AppEEARS, with the exception of visualizations. The API features are demonstrated in this tutorial.

## Hands on: Pulling AppEEARS Data via the API

*The following section was adapted from [LPDAAC's E-Learning Tutorials on the AppEEARS API](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/getting-started-appeears-api-r-point-request/) and modified to request data for NEON sites.*

## Getting Started with the AppEEARS API (Point Request)


***

**This section demonstrates how to use R to connect to the AppEEARS API**
The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples ([AppEEARS](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/)) offers a simple and efficient way to access and transform [geospatial data](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/products) from a variety of federal data archives in an easy-to-use web application interface. AppEEARS enables users to subset geospatial data spatially, temporally, and by band/layer for point and area samples. AppEEARS returns not only the requested data, but also the associated quality values, and offers interactive visualizations with summary statistics in the web interface. The [AppEEARS API](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/) offers users **programmatic access** to all features available in AppEEARS, with the exception of visualizations. The API features are demonstrated in this tutorial.

***
### Example: Submit a point request for multiple NEON sites to extract vegetation and land surface temperature data   

In this tutorial, Connecting to the AppEEARS API, querying the list of available products, submitting a point sample request, downloading the request, working with the AppEEARS Quality API, and loading the results into R for visualization are covered. AppEEARS point requests allow users to subset their desired data using latitude/longitude geographic coordinate pairs (points) for a time period of interest, and for specific data layers within data products. AppEEARS returns the valid data from the parameters defined within the sample request.

#### Data Used in the Example:
- Data layers: 
    - Combined MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI)  
        - [MCD15A3H.006](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD15A3H.006), 500m, 4 day: 'Lai_500m'      
    - Terra MODIS Land Surface Temperature    
        - [MOD11A2.006](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD11A2.006), 1000m, 8 day: 'LST_Day_1km', 'LST_Night_1km'

***
## Getting Started with the AppEEARS API       
### Load Packages
First, load the R packages necessary to run the tutorial. 

```r
# Load necessary packages into R                                               
library(getPass)            # A micro-package for reading passwords
library(httr)               # To send a request to the server/receive a response from the server
library(jsonlite)           # Implements a bidirectional mapping between JSON data and the most important R data types
library(ggplot2)            # Functions for graphing and mapping
library(tidyr)              # Function for working with tabular data
library(dplyr)              # Function for working with tabular data
library(readr)              # Read rectangular data like CSV
```
***
### Set Up the Output Directory
Set your input directory, and create an output directory for the results.


```r
outDir <- file.path('./data/')                 # Create an output directory if it doesn't exist
suppressWarnings(dir.create(outDir))                 
```

***
### Login to Earth Data

To submit a request, you must first login to the AppEEARS API. Use your private `R Script` to enter your NASA Earthdata login Username and Password. 


```r
source('EARTHDATA_Token.R') #path will change based on where you stored it
exists('user')
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Decode the username and password to be used to post login request.


```r
secret <- jsonlite::base64_enc(paste(user, password, sep = ":"))  # Encode the string of username and password
```

Next, assign the AppEEARS API URL to a static variable. 


```r
API_URL = "https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/"  # Set the AppEEARS API to a variable
```
Use the `httr` package to post your username and password. A successful login will provide you with a token to be used later in this tutorial to submit a request. For more information or if you are experiencing difficulties, please see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#login).

```r
# Insert API URL, call login service, set the component of HTTP header, and post the request to the server
response <- httr::POST(paste0(API_URL,"login"), 
                       add_headers("Authorization" = paste("Basic", gsub("\n", "", secret)),
                                   "Content-Type" ="application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8"),
                       body = "grant_type=client_credentials")

response_content <- content(response)                          # Retrieve the content of the request
token_response <- toJSON(response_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the response to the JSON object
remove(user, password, secret, response)                       # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore 
prettify(token_response)                                       # Print the prettified response
```

```
## {
##     "token_type": "Bearer",
##     "token": "t_QKI01dsmP7tVo3FXTlK55zqiTTCddNMj6qINL7tDUUYwVSgeUOTb-9ahLEJEiSr3c19uU5qW6p1DsujfJCFg",
##     "expiration": "2022-10-27T20:34:53Z"
## }
## 
```

**Above, you should see a Bearer token. Notice that this token will expire approximately 48 hours after being acquired.**

***
## Query Available Products
The product API provides details about all of the products and layers available in AppEEARS. For more information, please see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#product).

Below, call the product API to list all of the products available in AppEEARS.

```r
prods_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "product"))             # Request the info of all products from product service
prods_content <- content(prods_req)                      # Retrieve the content of request 
all_Prods <- toJSON(prods_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)    # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(prods_req, prods_content)                         # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
# prettify(all_Prods)                                      # Print the prettified product response
```
***

## Search and Explore Available Products

Create a list indexed by product name to make it easier to query a specific product.


```r
# Divides information from each product.
divided_products <- split(fromJSON(all_Prods), seq(nrow(fromJSON(all_Prods))))
# Create a list indexed by the product name and version
products <- setNames(divided_products,fromJSON(all_Prods)$ProductAndVersion)
# Print no. products available in AppEEARS
sprintf("AppEEARS currently supports %i products." ,length(products))   
```

```
## [1] "AppEEARS currently supports 162 products."
```

Next, look at the product's names and descriptions. Below, the 'ProductAndVersion' and 'Description' are printed for all products.


```r
# Loop through the products in the list and print the product name and description
for (p in products){                                   
  print(paste0(p$ProductAndVersion," is ",p$Description," from ",p$Source))  
}
```

The product service provides many useful details, including if a product is currently available in AppEEARS, a description, and information on the spatial and temporal resolution. Below, the product details are retrieved using 'ProductAndVersion'. 


```r
# Convert the MCD15A3H.006 info to JSON object and print the prettified info
prettify(toJSON(products$"MCD15A3H.006")) 
```

```

Also, the products can be searched using their description. Below, search for products containing Leaf Area Index in their description and make a list of their productAndVersion.


```r
LAI_Products <- list()                                        # Create an empty list 
for (p in products){                                          # Loop through the product list
  if (grepl('Leaf Area Index', p$Description )){              # Look through the product description for a keyword 
    LAI_Products <- append(LAI_Products, p$ProductAndVersion) # Append the LAI products to the list
  }
}

## Search and Explore Available Layers 

This API call will list all of the layers available for a given product. Each product is referenced by its `ProductAndVersion` property which is also referred to as the product_id. First, request the layers for the `MCD15A3H.006` product.


```r
# Request layers for the 1st product in the list: MCD15A3H.006
MCD15A3H_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"product/", desired_products[1]))  # Request the info of a product from product URL
MCD15A3H_content <- content(MCD15A3H_req)                             # Retrieve content of the request 
MCD15A3H_response <- toJSON(MCD15A3H_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)      # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(MCD15A3H_req, MCD15A3H_content)                                # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
#prettify(MCD15A3H_response)                                          # Print the prettified response
names(fromJSON(MCD15A3H_response))                                    # print the layer's names    
```

```
## [1] "FparExtra_QC"    "FparLai_QC"      "FparStdDev_500m" "Fpar_500m"      
## [5] "LaiStdDev_500m"  "Lai_500m"
```
Next, request the layers for the `MOD11A2.006` product.

```r
MOD11_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"product/", desired_products[2]))  # Request the info of a product from product URL
MOD11_content <- content(MOD11_req)                                # Retrieve content of the request
MOD11_response <- toJSON(MOD11_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)         # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(MOD11_req, MOD11_content)                                   # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
names(fromJSON(MOD11_response))                                    # print the layer names
```

```
##  [1] "Clear_sky_days"   "Clear_sky_nights" "Day_view_angl"    "Day_view_time"   
##  [5] "Emis_31"          "Emis_32"          "LST_Day_1km"      "LST_Night_1km"   
##  [9] "Night_view_angl"  "Night_view_time"  "QC_Day"           "QC_Night"
```

Lastly, select the desired layers and pertinent products and make a data frame using this information. This data frame will be inserted into the nested data frame that will be used to create a JSON object to submit a request in [Section 3](#section3).


```r
desired_layers <- c("LST_Day_1km","LST_Night_1km","Lai_500m")   # Create a vector of desired layers
desired_prods <- c("MOD11A2.006","MOD11A2.006","MCD15A3H.006")  # Create a vector of products including the desired layers
# Create a data frame including the desired data products and layers
layers <- data.frame(product = desired_prods, layer = desired_layers) 
```
***
## Submit a Point Request
The Submit task API call provides a way to submit a new request to be processed. It can accept data via JSON or query string. In the example below, create a JSON object and submit a request. Tasks in AppEEARS correspond to each request associated with your user account. Therefore, each of the calls to this service requires an authentication token.

***
### Compile a JSON Object
In this section, begin by setting up the information needed for a nested data frame that will be later converted to a JSON object for submitting an AppEEARS point request.
For detailed information on required JSON parameters, see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#tasks).

For point requests, beside the date range and desired layers information, the coordinates property must also be inside the task object. Optionally, set `id` and `category` properties to further identify your selected coordinates.

We'll start by requesting point-based data for `NEON.D17.SOAP` and `NEON.D17.SJER`:


```r
startDate <- "01-01-2020"       # Start of the date range for  which to extract data: MM-DD-YYYY
endDate <- "10-01-2020"         # End of the date range for  which to extract data: MM-DD-YYYY
recurring <- FALSE              # Specify True for a recurring date range
#yearRange <- [2000,2016]       # If recurring = True, set yearRange, change start/end date to MM-DD

lat <- c(37.0334, 37.1088)        # Latitude of the point sites 
lon <- c(-119.2622, -119.7323)    # Longitude of the point sites
id <- c("0","1")                      # ID for the point sites
category <- c("SOAP", "SJER") # Category for point sites

taskName <- 'NEON SOAP SJER Vegetation'           # Enter name of the task here
taskType <- 'point'                    # Specify the task type, it can be either "area" or "point"
```

To be able to successfully submit a task, the JSON object should be structured in a certain way. The code chunk below uses the information from the previous chunk to create a nested data frame. This nested data frame will be converted to JSON object that can be used to complete the request. 


```r
# Create a data frame including the date range for the request
date <- data.frame(startDate = startDate, endDate = endDate)
# Create a data frame including lat and long coordinates. ID and category name is optional.
coordinates <- data.frame(id = id, longitude = lon, latitude = lat, category = category)

task_info <- list(date,layers, coordinates)               # Create a list of data frames 
names(task_info) <- c("dates", "layers", "coordinates")   # Assign names

task <- list(task_info, taskName, taskType)               # Create a nested list 
names(task) <- c("params", "task_name", "task_type")      # Assign names 
remove(date, layers, coordinates, task_info)              # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
```
`toJSON` function from `jsonlite` package converts the type of data frame to a string that can be recognized as a JSON object to be submitted as a point request.  

```r
task_json <- toJSON(task,auto_unbox = TRUE)   # Convert to JSON object
```
***
### Submit a Task Request
Token information is needed to submit a request. Below the login token is assigned to a variable.

```r
token <- paste("Bearer", fromJSON(token_response)$token)     # Save login token to a variable
```

Below, post a call to the API **task service**, using the `task_json` created above.

```r
# Post the point request to the API task service
response <- POST(paste0(API_URL, "task"), 
                 body = task_json , 
                 encode = "json", 
                 add_headers(Authorization = token, "Content-Type" = "application/json"))

task_content <- content(response)                                 # Retrieve content of the request 
task_response <- prettify(toJSON(task_content, auto_unbox = TRUE))# Convert the content to JSON object
remove(response, task_content)                                    # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
task_response                                                     # Print the prettified task response
```

```
## {
##     "task_id": "239d2148-6e07-4f78-b137-2bfbae15f6a6",
##     "status": "pending"
## }
## 
```
***
### Retrieve Task Status
This API call will list all of the requests associated with your user account, automatically sorted by date descending with the most recent requests listed first.
The AppEEARS API contains some helpful formatting resources. Below, limit the API response to 2 entries for the last 2 requests and set pretty to True to format the response as an organized JSON object to make it easier to read. Additional information on AppEEARS API
[retrieve task](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#retrieve-task), [pagination](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#pagination), and [formatting](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#formatting) can be found in the API documentation.


```r
params <- list(limit = 2, pretty = TRUE)                            # Set up query parameters
# Request the task status of last 2 requests from task URL
response_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"task"), query = params, add_headers(Authorization = token))
response_content <- content(response_req)                           # Retrieve content of the request
status_response <- toJSON(response_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)      # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(response_req, response_content)                              # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore                         
prettify(status_response)                                           # Print the prettified response
```

The task_id that was generated when submitting your request can also be used to retrieve a task status. 

```r
task_id <- fromJSON(task_response)$task_id                 # Extract the task_id of submitted point request
# Request the task status of a task with the provided task_id from task URL
status_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"task/", task_id), add_headers(Authorization = token)) 
status_content <- content(status_req)                       # Retrieve content of the request       
statusResponse <-toJSON(status_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the content to JSON object
stat <- fromJSON(statusResponse)$status                     # Assign the task status to a variable  
remove(status_req, status_content)                          # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
prettify(statusResponse)                                    # Print the prettified response

Retrieve the task status every 5 seconds. The task status should be `done` to be able to download the output.

```r
while (stat != 'done') {
  Sys.sleep(5)
  # Request the task status and retrieve content of request from task URL
  stat_content <- content(GET(paste0(API_URL,"task/", task_id), add_headers(Authorization = token)))
  stat <-fromJSON(toJSON(stat_content, auto_unbox = TRUE))$status    # Get the status
  remove(stat_content) 
  print(stat)
}
```

## Download a Request

### Explore Files in Request Output 

Before downloading the request output, examine the files contained in the request output.

```r
# Request the task bundle info from API bundle URL
response <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "bundle/", task_id), add_headers(Authorization = token))
response_content <- content(response)                          # Retrieve content of the request
bundle_response <- toJSON(response_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the content to JSON object
prettify(bundle_response)                                       # Print the prettified response
```

```
## {
##     "message": "Document not found: {'task_id': '239d2148-6e07-4f78-b137-2bfbae15f6a6'}"
## }
## 
```
***
## Download Files in a Request (Automation) 
The bundle API provides information about completed tasks. For any completed task, a bundle can be queried to return the files contained as a part of the task request. Below, call the bundle API and return all of the output files. Next, read the contents of the bundle in JSON format and loop through file_id to automate downloading all of the output files into the output directory. For more information, please see [AppEEARS API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#bundle).

```r
bundle <- fromJSON(bundle_response)$files
for (id in bundle$file_id){
  # retrieve the filename from the file_id
  filename <- bundle[bundle$file_id == id,]$file_name     
  # create a destination directory to store the file in
  filepath <- paste(outDir,filename, sep = "/")
  suppressWarnings(dir.create(dirname(filepath)))
  # write the file to disk using the destination directory and file name 
  response <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "bundle/", task_id, "/", id),
                  write_disk(filepath, overwrite = TRUE),
                  progress(),
                  add_headers(Authorization = token))
  }
```

## Explore AppEEARS Quality Service
The quality API provides quality details about all of the data products available in AppEEARS. Below are examples of how to query the quality API for listing quality products, layers, and values. The final example ([Section 5c.](#decode)) demonstrates how AppEEARS quality services can be leveraged to decode pertinent quality values for your data. For more information visit [AppEEARS API documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#quality).

First, reset pagination to include offset which allows you to set the number of results to skip before starting to return entries. Next, make a call to list all of the data product layers and the associated quality product and layer information.


```r
params <- list(limit = 6, offset = 20, pretty = TRUE)     # Set up the query parameters
q_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "quality"), query = params)  # Request the quality info from quality API_URL
q_content <- content(q_req)                               # Retrieve the content of request
q_response <- toJSON(q_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)        # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(params, q_req, q_content)                          # Remove the variables that are not needed 
prettify(q_response)                                      # Print the prettified quality information
```

## Decode Quality Values
This API call will decode the bits for a given quality value. 

```r
quality_value <- 1                        # Assign a quality value to a variable 
# Request and retrieve information for provided quality value from quality API URL 
response <- content(GET(paste0(API_URL, "quality/", productAndVersion, "/", quality_layer, "/", quality_value)))
q_response <- toJSON(response, auto_unbox = TRUE)     # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(response)                                      # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
prettify(q_response)                                  # Print the prettified response
```

## Load Request Output and Visualize

Here, load the CSV file containing the results from your request using `readr` package, and create some basic visualizations using the `ggplot2` package.

## Load a CSV
Use the `readr` package to load the CSV file containing the results from the AppEEARS request.

```r
# Make a list of csv files in the output directory
files <- list.files(outDir, pattern = "\\MOD11A2-006-results.csv$") 
# Read the MOD11A2 results
df <- read_csv(paste0(outDir,"/", files))
```
Select the MOD11A2.006 LST Day column for the data from `SOAP` using the `dplyr` package.

```r
lst_SOAP <- df %>%
  # Filter df
  filter(Category == "SOAP") %>%  
  # Select desired columns
  select(Latitude, Longitude, Date ,MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km, MOD11A2_006_LST_Night_1km) 
```
Extract information for LST_DAY_1KM from MOD11_response of product service call from earlier in the tutorial.

```r
#fromJSON(MOD11_response)$LST_Day_1km                        # Extract all the info for LST_Day_1km layer

fillValue <- fromJSON(MOD11_response)$LST_Day_1km$FillValue  # Assign fill value to a variable
unit <- fromJSON(MOD11_response)$LST_Day_1km$Units           # Assign unit to a variable
sprintf("Fill value for LST_DAY_1KM is: %i" ,fillValue)      # Print LST_DAY_1KM fill value
```

```
## [1] "Fill value for LST_DAY_1KM is: 0"
```

```r
sprintf("Unit for LST_DAY_1KM is: %s" ,unit)                 # Print LST_DAY_1KM unit 
```

```
## [1] "Unit for LST_DAY_1KM is: Kelvin"
```
***
## Plot Results (Line/Scatter Plots)
Next, plot a time series of daytime LST for the selected point. Below, filter the LST data to exclude fill values. 

```r
lst_SOAP <- lst_SOAP %>%
  # exclude NoData
  filter(MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km != fillValue)%>%
  filter(MOD11A2_006_LST_Night_1km != fillValue)
```
Next, plot LST Day as a time series with some additional formatting using `ggplot2`.

```r
ggplot(lst_SOAP)+
  geom_line(aes(x= Date, y = MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km), size=1, color="blue")+
  geom_point(aes(x= Date, y = MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km), shape=18 , size = 3, color="blue")+
  labs(title = "Time Series",
       x = "Date",
       y = sprintf( "LST_Day_1km (%s)", unit))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "16 day")+ 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(250, 325), breaks = seq(250, 325, 10))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(2.5),hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(1)),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray", colour = "black"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", angle= 315 , size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", angle= 0, size = 10)
        )
```

Using the `tidyr` package, the LST Day and Night values for Grand Canyon NP are being gathered in a single column to be used to make a plot including both  `LST_Day_1km` and `LST_Night_1km`.

```r
lst_SOAP_DN <- tidyr::gather(lst_SOAP, key = Tstat , value = LST, MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km, MOD11A2_006_LST_Night_1km)
lst_SOAP_DN[1:5,]                     # print the five first observations 
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 5
##   Latitude Longitude Date       Tstat                     LST
##      <dbl>     <dbl> <date>     <chr>                   <dbl>
## 1     37.0     -119. 2019-12-27 MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km  278.
## 2     37.0     -119. 2020-01-01 MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km  283.
## 3     37.0     -119. 2020-01-09 MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km  280.
## 4     37.0     -119. 2020-01-17 MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km  283.
## 5     37.0     -119. 2020-01-25 MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km  285.
```

Next, plot LST Day and Night as a time series with some additional formatting.


```r
ggplot(lst_SOAP_DN)+
  geom_line(aes(x= Date, y = LST, color = Tstat), size=1)+
  geom_point(aes(x= Date, y = LST, color = Tstat), shape=18 , size = 3)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "blue"))+
  scale_color_manual(values=c('red','blue'))+
  labs(title = "Time Series",
       x = "Date",
       y = sprintf( "LST_Day_1km (%s)",unit))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "16 day")+  
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(250, 325), breaks = seq(250, 325, 10))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(2.5), hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(1)),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray", colour = "black"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", angle= 315 , size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", angle= 0, size = 10),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank()
        )
```

<img src="07-NASA_EOS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="1152" />

Finally, bring in the daytime LST data from `SJER` , and compare with daytime LST at `SOAP` , shown below in a scatterplot using `ggplot2` package. 
Here, the `dplyr` is used to extract the LST_DAY_1km for `SJER`.  

```r
lst_SJER <- df %>%
  filter(MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km != fillValue) %>%        # Filter fill value 
  filter(Category == "SJER")%>%                           # Filter SJER national park
  select(Date, MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km)                   # Select desired columns
```
Make a scatterplot.

```r
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x=lst_SOAP$MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km, y=lst_SJER$MOD11A2_006_LST_Day_1km[-11]), shape=18 , size = 3, color="blue")+
  labs(title = "MODIS LST: SOAP vs. SJER, 2020",
       x = sprintf("SOAP: LST_Day_1km (%s)",unit),
       y = sprintf( "SJER: LST_Day_1km (%s)",unit))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(1)),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray", colour = "black"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(face ="bold",color="black", size = 10)
  )
```

This example can provide a template to use for your own research workflows. Leveraging the AppEEARS API for searching, extracting, and formatting analysis ready data, and loading it directly into R means that you can keep your entire research workflow in a single software program, from start to finish.

**This tutorial demonstrates how to use R to connect to the AppEEARS API**
The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples ([AppEEARS](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/)) offers a simple and efficient way to access and transform [geospatial data](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/products) from a variety of federal data archives in an easy-to-use web application interface. AppEEARS enables users to subset geospatial data spatially, temporally, and by band/layer for point and area samples. AppEEARS returns not only the requested data, but also the associated quality values, and offers interactive visualizations with summary statistics in the web interface. The [AppEEARS API](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/) offers users **programmatic access** to all features available in AppEEARS, with the exception of visualizations. The API features are demonstrated in this tutorial.

## Submit an area request using a NEON site boundary as the region of interest for extracting elevation, vegetation and land surface temperature data    

In this section: 
  * Connecting to the AppEEARS API, 
  * Querying the list of available products, 
  * Submitting an area sample request, downloading the request, 
  * Working with the AppEEARS Quality API, and 
  * Loading the results into R for visualization. 
  
AppEEARS area sample requests allow users to subset their desired data by spatial area via vector polygons (shapefiles or GeoJSONs). Users can also reproject and reformat the output data. AppEEARS returns the valid data from the parameters defined within the sample request.       

#### Data Used in this Example:
- Data layers: 
    - NASA MEaSUREs Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3 Digital Elevation Model  
        - [SRTMGL1_NC.003](https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/SRTM/SRTMGL1.003), 30m, static: 'SRTM_DEM' 
    - Combined MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI)  
        - [MCD15A3H.006](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD15A3H.006), 500m, 4 day: 'Lai_500m'      
    - Terra MODIS Land Surface Temperature    
        - [MOD11A2.006](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD11A2.006), 1000m, 8 day: 'LST_Day_1km', 'LST_Night_1km'

***
## Getting Started with an Area Request     
### Load Packages for an Area Request

First, load the R packages necessary to run the tutorial. 

```r
# Load necessary packages into R                                               
library(httr)              # To send a request to the server/receive a response from the server
library(jsonlite)          # Implements a bidirectional mapping between JSON data and the most important R data types
library(geojsonio)         # Convert data from various R classes to 'GeoJSON' 
library(geojsonR)          # Functions for processing GeoJSON objects
library(rgdal)             # Functions for spatial data input/output
library(sp)                # classes and methods for spatial data types
library(raster)            # Classes and methods for raster data
library(rasterVis)         # Advanced plotting functions for raster objects 
library(ggplot2)           # Functions for graphing and mapping
library(RColorBrewer)      # Creates nice color schemes
```
***
## Set Up the Output Directory
Create an output directory for the results.

```r
outDir <- './data/'               # Create an output directory if it doesn't exist
```
Next, assign the AppEEARS API URL to a static variable. 

```r
API_URL = 'https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/'  # Set the AppEEARS API to a variable
```
***
## Load your Earth Data Token
To submit a request, you must first login to the AppEEARS API. Use your `token` script to import your credentials.

```r
source('EARTHDATA_Token.R') #path will change based on where you stored it
```
Decode the username and password to be used to post login request.

```r
secret <- jsonlite::base64_enc(paste(user, password, sep = ":"))  # Encode the string of username and password
```
Next, assign the AppEEARS API URL to a static variable. 

```r
API_URL = 'https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/'     # Set the AppEEARS API to a variable
```
Use the `httr` package to post your username and password. A successful login will provide you with a token to be used later in this tutorial to submit a request. For more information or if you are experiencing difficulties, please see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#login).

```r
# Insert API URL, call login service, set the component of HTTP header, and post the request to the server
response <- httr::POST(paste0(API_URL,"login"), add_headers("Authorization" = paste("Basic", gsub("\n", "", secret)),
                                                 "Content-Type" =
                                                   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8"), 
                 body = "grant_type=client_credentials")

response_content <- content(response)                          # Retrieve the content of the request
token_response <- toJSON(response_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the response to the JSON object
remove(user, password, secret, response)                       # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore 
prettify(token_response)                                       # Print the prettified response
```

```
## {
##     "token_type": "Bearer",
##     "token": "t_QKI01dsmP7tVo3FXTlK55zqiTTCddNMj6qINL7tDUUYwVSgeUOTb-9ahLEJEiSr3c19uU5qW6p1DsujfJCFg",
##     "expiration": "2022-10-27T20:34:53Z"
## }
## 
```

**Above, you should see a Bearer token. Notice that this token will expire approximately 48 hours after being acquired.**

***
## Query Available Products
The product API provides details about all of the products and layers available in AppEEARS. For more information, please see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#product).

Below, call the product API to list all of the products available in AppEEARS.

```r
prods_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "product"))             # Request the info of all products from product service
prods_content <- content(prods_req)                      # Retrieve the content of request 
all_Prods <- toJSON(prods_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)    # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(prods_req, prods_content)                         # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
# prettify(all_Prods)                                      # Print the prettified product response
```
***
## Search and Explore Available Products
Create a list indexed by product name to make it easier to query a specific product.

```r
# divides information from each product.
divided_products <- split(fromJSON(all_Prods), seq(nrow(fromJSON(all_Prods))))
# Create a list indexed by the product name and version
products <- setNames(divided_products,fromJSON(all_Prods)$ProductAndVersion)
# Print no. products available in AppEEARS
sprintf("AppEEARS currently supports %i products." ,length(products))   
```

```
## [1] "AppEEARS currently supports 159 products."
```

Next, look at the product's names and descriptions. Below, the 'ProductAndVersion' and 'Description' are printed for all products.

```r
# Loop through the products in the list and Print the product name and description
for (p in products){                                   
  print(paste0(p$ProductAndVersion," is ",p$Description," from ",p$Source))  
}
```

## Search and Explore Available Layers
This API call will list all of the layers available for a given product. Each product is referenced by its `ProductAndVersion` property which is also referred to as the product_id. First, request the layers for the `MCD15A3H.006` product.


```r
# Request layers for the 1st product in the list: MCD15A3H.006
MCD15A3H_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"product/", desired_products[1]))  # Request the info of a product from product URL
MCD15A3H_content <- content(MCD15A3H_req)                             # Retrieve content of the request 
MCD15A3H_response <- toJSON(MCD15A3H_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)      # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(MCD15A3H_req, MCD15A3H_content)                                # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
#prettify(MCD15A3H_response)                                          # Print the prettified response
names(fromJSON(MCD15A3H_response))                                    # print the layer's names    
```

```

## [5] "LaiStdDev_500m"  "Lai_500m"
```
Next, request the layers for the `MOD11A2.006` product.

```r
MOD11_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"product/", desired_products[2]))  # Request the info of a product from product URL
MOD11_content <- content(MOD11_req)                                # Retrieve content of the request
MOD11_response <- toJSON(MOD11_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)         # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(MOD11_req, MOD11_content)                                   # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
names(fromJSON(MOD11_response))                                    # print the layer names

##  [9] "Night_view_angl"  "Night_view_time"  "QC_Day"           "QC_Night"
```
Next, request the layers for the`SRTMGL1_NC.003` product.

```r
SRTMGL1_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"product/", desired_products[3]))# Request the info of a product from product URL
SRTMGL1_content <- content(SRTMGL1_req)                            # Retrieve content of the request  
SRTMGL1_response <- toJSON(SRTMGL1_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)     # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(SRTMGL1_req, SRTMGL1_content)                               # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
names(fromJSON(SRTMGL1_response))
```

```
## [1] "SRTMGL1_DEM"
```

Lastly, select the desired layers and pertinent products and make a data frame using this information. This list will be inserted into the JSON file used to submit a request.

```r
# Create a vector of desired layers
desired_layers <- c("LST_Day_1km","LST_Night_1km","Lai_500m","SRTMGL1_DEM")     
# Create a vector of products including the desired layers
desired_prods <- c("MOD11A2.006","MOD11A2.006","MCD15A3H.006","SRTMGL1_NC.003") 
# Create a data frame including the desired data products and layers
layers <- data.frame(product = desired_prods, layer = desired_layers)              
```

***
## Submit an Area Request
The Submit task API call provides a way to submit a new request to be processed. It can accept data via JSON or query string. In the example below, create a JSON object and submit a request. Tasks in AppEEARS correspond to each request associated with your user account. Therefore, each of the calls to this service requires an authentication token.

***
### Load a Shapefile
In this section, begin by loading a shapefile using the `rgdal` package. The shapefile is publicly available for download from the [NPS website](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2224545?lnv=True).

```r
onaq <- readOGR(dsn= "./ONAQ_extent", layer = "D15_ONAQ_C1_P1_v2")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "C:\Users\rohan\Environmental-Informatics-Using-Research-Infrastructures-and-their-Data\ONAQ_extent", layer: "D15_ONAQ_C1_P1_v2"
## with 1 features
## It has 1 fields
```

```r
onaq_wgs84 <- spTransform(onaq, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"))
```

convert the Spatial data frame to GeoJSON using `geojson_json` from `geojsonio` package, which makes it easy to create the geospatial data in and out of GeoJSON format.

```r
onaq_json <- geojsonio::geojson_json(onaq_wgs84, geometry = "polygon")    # Convert the data frame to GeoJSON
```

```
## Warning: 'geojsonlint' not installed, skipping GeoJSON linting
```
Next, the GeoJSON object can be read as a list using the `FROM_GeoJson` function from `geojsonR` package.  

```r
onaq_js <- geojsonR::FROM_GeoJson(onaq_json)                    # Read the GeoJSON 
```
***
## Search and Explore Available Projections
The spatial API provides some helper services used to support submitting area task requests. The call below will retrieve the list of supported projections in AppEEARS. For more information, please see the [AppEEARS API](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#spatial)


```r
proj_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "spatial/proj"))          # Request the projection info from API_URL            
proj_content <- content(proj_req)                         # Retrieve content of the request
proj_response <- toJSON(proj_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(proj_req, proj_content)                            # Remove the variables that are not needed 
projs <- fromJSON(proj_response)                          # Read the projects as a R object
projection <- projs[projs$Name=="geographic",]            # Choose the projection for your output
```
***
## Compile a JSON Object
In this section, begin by setting up the information needed for a nested data list that will be later converted to a JSON object for submitting an AppEEARS area request.For detailed information on required JSON parameters, see the [API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#tasks).


```r
taskName <- 'NEON-ONAQ'    # Enter name of the task, 'ONAQ' used here
taskType <- 'area'            # Type of task, it can be either "area" or "point"

projection <- projection$Name # Set output projection 

outFormat <- 'geotiff'        # Set output file format type. it can be either 'geotiff' or 'netcdf4'

startDate <- '01-01-2018'     # Start of the date range for which to extract data: MM-DD-YYYY
endDate <- '12-31-2019'       # End of the date range for which to extract data: MM-DD-YYYY
recurring <- FALSE            # Specify True for a recurring date range
#yearRange = [2000,2016]      # If recurring = True, set yearRange, change start/end date to MM-DD
```
To be able to successfully submit a task, the JSON object should be structured in a certain way. The code chunk below uses the information from the previous chunk to create a nested data frame. This nested data frame will be converted to JSON object that can be used to complete the request. 

```r
# Create a data frame including the date range for the request
date <- data.frame(startDate = startDate, endDate = endDate)

# Create a list including the projection and add the output format info
out <- list(projection )
names(out) <- c("projection")
out$format$type <- outFormat

# Change the GeoJSON format for successful task submission
onaq_js$features[[1]]$geometry$coordinates <- list(onaq_js$features[[1]]$geometry$coordinates)

task_info <- list(date, layers, out, onaq_js)                 # Create a list of data frames 
names(task_info) <- c("dates", "layers", "output", "geo")       # Assign names

task <- list(task_info, taskName, taskType)                     # Create a nested list 
names(task) <- c("params", "task_name", "task_type")            # Assign names  
```
`toJSON` function from `jsonlite` package converts the type of data frame to a string that can be recognized as a JSON object to be submitted as an area request.

```r
task_json <- jsonlite::toJSON(task,auto_unbox = TRUE, digits = 10)
```
***
## Submit a Task Request 
Token information is needed to submit a request. Below the login token is assigned to a variable.

```r
token <- paste("Bearer", fromJSON(token_response)$token)     # Save login token to a variable
```
Below, post a call to the API task service, using the `task_json` created above.

```r
# Post the point request to the API task service
response <- POST(paste0(API_URL, "task"), body = task_json , encode = "json", 
                 add_headers(Authorization = token, "Content-Type" = "application/json"))

task_content <- content(response)                           # Retrieve content of the request 
task_response <- toJSON(task_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)    # Convert the content to JSON and prettify it
prettify(task_response)                                     # Print the task response
```
A JSON downloaded from a previous request containing the information from that request can also be used if available

```r
# task <- jsonlite::toJSON(jsonlite::read_json("LST-request.json"), digits = 10, auto_unbox = TRUE)
# response <- POST(paste0(API_URL,"task"), body = task, encode = "json", 
#                        add_headers(Authorization = token, "Content-Type" = "application/json"))
# task_response <- prettify(toJSON(content(response), auto_unbox = TRUE))
# task_response
```
***
## Retrieve Task Status
This API call will list all of the requests associated with your user account, automatically sorted by date, with the most recent requests listed first.

The AppEEARS API contains some helpful formatting resources. Below, limit the API response to 2 entries for the last 2 requests and set pretty to True to format the response as an organized JSON, making it easier to read. Additional information on AppEEARS API
[retrieve task](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#retrieve-task), [pagination](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#pagination), and [formatting](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#formatting) can be found in the API documentation.


```r
params <- list(limit = 2, pretty = TRUE)                            # Set up query parameters
# Request the task status of last 2 requests from task URL
response_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"task"), query = params, add_headers(Authorization = token))
response_content <- content(response_req)                           # Retrieve content of the request
status_response <- toJSON(response_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)      # Convert the content to JSON object
remove(response_req, response_content)                              # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore     
prettify(status_response)                                           # Print the prettified response
```

```
## {
##     "message": "You don't have the permission to access the requested resource. It is either read-protected or not readable by the server."
## }
## 
```

The task_id that was generated when submitting your request can also be used to retrieve a task status. 
Notice, this could get longer because of the number of vertices in the shapefile that will be printed.

```r
# task_id <- fromJSON(task_response)$task_id                 # Extract the task_id of submitted point request
# # Request the task status of a task with the provided task_id from task URL
# status_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"task/", task_id), add_headers(Authorization = token)) 
# status_content <- content(status_req)                       # Retrieve content of the request       
# statusResponse <-toJSON(status_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)  # Convert the content to JSON object
# remove(status_req, status_content)                          # Remove the variables that are not needed 
# prettify(statusResponse)                                    # Print the prettified response
```
Retrieve the task status every 60 seconds. The task status should be `done` to be able to download the output.

```r
# Request the task status of last request from task URL
stat_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL,"task"), query = list(limit = 1), add_headers(Authorization = token))
stat_content <- content(stat_req)                           # Retrieve content of the request
stat_response <- toJSON(stat_content, auto_unbox = TRUE)    # Convert the content to JSON object
stat <- fromJSON(stat_response)$status                      # Assign the task status to a variable
remove(stat_req, stat_content)                              # Remove the variables that are not needed      
```
***  
## Download a Request
### Explore Files in Request Output 
Before downloading the request output, examine the files contained in the request output.

```r
task_id <- fromJSON(task_response)[[1]]
response <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "bundle/", task_id), add_headers(Authorization = token))
bundle_response <- prettify(toJSON(content(response), auto_unbox = TRUE))
```

***
## Download Files in a Request (Automation) 
The bundle API provides information about completed tasks. For any completed task, a bundle can be queried to return the files contained as a part of the task request. Below, call the bundle API and return all of the output files. Next, read the contents of the bundle in JSON format and loop through file_id to automate downloading all of the output files into the output directory. For more information, please see [AppEEARS API Documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#bundle).

```r
bundle <- fromJSON(bundle_response)$files
for (id in bundle$file_id){
  # retrieve the filename from the file_id
  filename <- bundle[bundle$file_id == id,]$file_name           
  # create a destination directory to store the file in
  filepath <- paste(outDir,filename, sep = "/")
  suppressWarnings(dir.create(dirname(filepath)))
  # write the file to disk using the destination directory and file name 
  response <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "bundle/", task_id, "/", id), 
                  write_disk(filepath, overwrite = TRUE), progress(),
                  add_headers(Authorization = token))
}
```

Now, take a look at "R_output" directory. Separate folders are made for each product and the outputs are saved in these folders. 


```r
# List of directories in the R_output directory
list.dirs(outDir)
```

## Explore AppEEARS Quality Service
The quality API provides quality details about all of the data products available in AppEEARS. Below are examples of how to query the quality API for listing quality products, layers, and values. The final example demonstrates how AppEEARS quality services can be leveraged to decode pertinent quality values for your data. For more information visit [AppEEARS API documentation](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/api/?language=R#quality)

First, reset pagination to include offset which allows you to set the number of results to skip before starting to return entries. Next, make a call to list all of the data product layers and the associated quality product and layer information.

```r
params <- list(limit = 6, offset = 20, pretty = TRUE)          # Assign query to a variable
# Request the specified quality layer info from quality API
quality_req <- GET(paste0(API_URL, "quality"), query = params)
quality_content <- content(quality_req)                        # Retrieve the content of request
quality_response <- toJSON(quality_content, auto_unbox = TRUE) # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(quality_req, quality_content)                           # Remove the variables that are not needed 
prettify(quality_response)
```

## Decode Quality Values
This API call will decode the bits for a given quality value. 

```r
quality_value <- 1                        # Assign a quality value to a variable 
# Request and retrieve information for provided quality value from quality API URL 
response <- content(GET(paste0(API_URL, "quality/", productAndVersion, "/", quality_layer, "/", quality_value)))
q_response <- toJSON(response, auto_unbox = TRUE)     # Convert the info to JSON object
remove(response)                                      # Remove the variables that are not needed anymore
prettify(q_response)                                  # Print the prettified response
```

```

```

## BONUS: Load Request Output and Visualize
Here, load one of the output GeoTIFFs and show some basic visualizations using the `rasterVis` and `ggplot2` packages.

## Load a GeoTIFF
First, created a raster object by calling the raster() function from the `raster` package.

```r
# Create a raster object using the directory previously extracted
dem <- raster(SRTMGL1_NC_dir)
```
***
## Plot a GeoTIFF
Make a plot of DEM data and add some additional parameters to the plot. 


```r
gplot(dem) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(name = "Elevation (m)", palette = "BrBG", na.value=NA) +
  coord_fixed(expand = F, ratio = 1) +
  labs(title = "SRTM DEM: NEON SOAP")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = rel(2),hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA , color = "black", size = 0.8),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "#6D9EC1",size = 2, linetype = "solid"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.001, linetype = 'solid',colour = "gray"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.001, linetype = 'solid',colour = "gray"))
```

This example can provide a template to use for your own research workflows. Leveraging the AppEEARS API for searching, extracting, and formatting analysis ready data, and loading it directly into R means that you can keep your entire research workflow in a single software program, from start to finish.

## NASA EOS Coding Lab #2

1. Choose two NEON sites in *different* ecoregions.  Then complete the following for **each** of your two NEON sites:

2. Using your Earth Data account submit a point-based request to AppEEARS to pull 250m NDVI from AQUA and TERA for 2017, 2018, & 2019.

  *Hint: How might you decide on the lat/lon to submit?  Metadata for the site?  NEON TOS data?*
  
3. Use QA/QC values to filter out 'poor quality'.

  *Hint: Look at the QA/QC files that accompany your request*
  
4. Plot 3 years of NDVI from MODIS AQUA and TERA as a timeseries.

5. Constrain a 3-week window for 'peak greeness' from MODIS and highlight it on your timeseries plot.

6. Pull the canopy-level gcc90 from PhenoCam for the same site and the same time period as above.

  *Hint: Check the numbering of your PhenoCam on the [PhenoCam gallery](https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/gallery/) *
  
7. Plot the PhenoCam and MODIS timeseries on the same plot.


8. Constrain a 3-week window for 'peak greeness' from PhenoCam and highlight it on your timeseries.
  *Hint: Remember our PhenoCam discussions regarding early 'extra green' leaves?  You'll need to use some logic for this, not just a `max` *
  
9. Find the timing of the AOP flights that have occured at your sites over the same time period.  Add those dates as a vertical line.


**BONUS:** If you'd like to submit an area-based request instead you can do so using the shapefiles for each NEON site [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19MJee-UKY-McbxDuYYCINhWRbqn4bbGO?usp=sharing)

## NASA EOS Culmination Write Up

Write up a 1-page **derived data product or research pipeline proposal** summary of a project that you might want to explore using NASA EOS data. Include the types of data that you would need to implement this project and how you would retrieve them. Save this summary as you will be refining and adding to your ideas over the course of the semester.  

Suggestions: 

1. Tables or bullet lists of **specific** data products

2. An **overarching high-quality figure** to show how these data align

3. One paragraph summarizing *how* this data or analysis is useful to **you and/or the infrastructure**.
