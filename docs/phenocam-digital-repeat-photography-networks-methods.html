<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Introduction to Digital Repeat Photography Methods<a href="phenocam-digital-repeat-photography-networks-methods.html#introduction-to-digital-repeat-photography-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The concept of repeat photography for studying environmental has been
introduced to scientists long time ago (See Stephens et al., 1987).
But in the past decade the idea has gained much popularity for monitoring
environmental change (e.g., Sonnentag et al., 2012).
One of the main applications of digital repeat photography is studying vegetation
phenology for a diverse range of ecosystems and biomes (Richardson et al., 2019).
The methods has also shown great applicability in other fields such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>assessing the seasonality of gross primary production,</p></li>
<li><p>salt marsh restoration,</p></li>
<li><p>monitoring tidal wetlands,</p></li>
<li><p>investigating growth in croplands, and</p></li>
<li><p>evaluating phenological data products derived from satellite remote sensing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Obtaining quantitative data from digital repeat photography images is usually
performed by defining appropriate region of interest, also know as ROI’s,
and for the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) color channels, calculating
pixel value (intensity) statistics across the pixels within each ROI.
ROI boundaries are delineated by mask files which define which pixels
are included and which are excluded from these calculations.</p>
<p>The masks are then used to extract color-based time series from a stack of images.
Following the time-series, statistical metrics are used to obtain
1-day and 3-day summary time series.
From the summary product time series, phenological transition dates
corresponding to the start and the end of green-up and green-down
phenological phases are calculated.
In this chapter we explain this process by starting from general
image processing tools and then to phenocam-based software applications.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bnasr/phenocamapi" class="uri">https://github.com/bnasr/phenocamapi</a> <em>phenocamapi</em> R package</a>
is developed to simplify interacting with the
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu" target="_blank">PhenoCam network</a>
dataset and perform data wrangling steps on PhenoCam sites’ data and metadata.</p>
<p>This tutorial will show you the basic commands for accessing PhenoCam data
through the PhenoCam API. The <em>phenocampapi</em> R package is developed and maintained by
<a href="https://bnasr.github.io/" target="_blank">Bijan Seyednarollah</a>.
The most recent release is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/bnasr/phenocamapi" target="_blank">PhenocamAPI</a>).
<a href="https://github.com/bnasr/phenocamapi/tree/master/vignettes" target ="_blank">Additional vignettes</a>
can be found on how to merge external time-series (e.g. Flux data) with the
PhenoCam time-series.</p>
<p>We begin with several useful skills and tools for extracting PhenoCam data
directly from the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring the PhenoCam metadata</li>
<li>Filtering the dataset by site attributes</li>
<li>Extracting the list of midday images</li>
<li>Downloading midday images for a given time range</li>

<p>Each PhenoCam site has specific metadata including but not limited to how a site
is set up and where it is located, what vegetation type is visible from the
camera, and its climate regime. Each PhenoCam may have zero to several Regions
of Interest (ROIs) per vegetation type. The <em>phenocamapi</em> package is an
interface to interact with the PhenoCam server to extract those data and
process them in an R environment.</p>
<p>To explore the PhenoCam data, we’ll use several packages for this tutorial.</p>

<p>We may want to explore some of the patterns in the metadata before we jump into
specific locations.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual
Temperature (MAT) across the different field site and classify those by the
primary vegetation type (<code>primary_veg_type</code>) for each site. We can find out what
the abbreviations for the vegetation types mean from the following table:</p>

<p>While PhenoCam sites may have many images in a given day, many simple analyses
can use just the midday image when the sun is most directly overhead the canopy.
Therefore, extracting a list of midday images (only one image a day) can be useful.</p>

<p>When we work with images, all data we work with is generally on the scale of each
individual pixel in the image. Therefore, for large images we will be working with
large matrices that hold the value for each pixel. Keep this in mind before opening
some of the matrices we’ll be creating this tutorial as it can take a while for
them to load.</p>

<p>A histogram of the colors can be useful to understanding what our image is made
up of. Using the <code>density()</code> function from the base <em>stats</em> package, we can extract

<p>Haziness of an image can be estimated using the <code>getHazeFactor()</code> function. This
function is based on the method described in
<a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/detecting-foggy-images-and-estimating-the-haze-degree-factor-jcsb.1000226.pdf">Mao et al. (2014)</a>.
The technique was originally developed to for <em>“detecting foggy images and
estimating the haze degree factor”</em> for a wide range of outdoor conditions.</p>
<p>The function returns a vector of two numeric values:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>haze</strong> as the haze degree and</li>
<li><strong>A0</strong> as the global atmospheric light, as it is explained in the original paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>The PhenoCam standards classify any image with the haze degree greater
than 0.4 as a significantly foggy image.</p>

<p>In this section, we’ll learn how to use an interactive open-source toolkit, the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xROI/index.html" target="_blank">xROI R package</a>
that facilitates the process of time series extraction and improves the quality
of the final data. The xROI package provides a responsive environment for
scientists to interactively:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>delineate regions of interest (ROIs),</li>
<li>handle field of view (FOV) shifts, and</li>
<li>extract and export time series data characterizing color-based metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the <em>xROI</em> R package, the user can detect FOV shifts with minimal difficulty.
The software gives user the opportunity to re-adjust mask files or redraw new
ones every time an FOV shift occurs.</p>

<p>The R language and Shiny package were used as the main development tool for xROI,
while Markdown, HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages were used to improve the
interactivity. While Shiny apps are primarily used for web-based applications to
be used online, the package authors used Shiny for its graphical user interface
capabilities. In other words, both the User Interface (UI) and server modules are run
locally from the same machine and hence no internet connection is required (after
installation). The xROI’s UI element presents a side-panel for data entry and
three main tab-pages, each responsible for a specific task. The server-side
element consists of R and bash scripts. Image processing and geospatial features
were performed using the <code>Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)</code> and the
<code>rgdal</code> and <code>raster</code> R packages.</p>

<code>tiff</code>, <code>shiny</code>, <code>shinyjs</code>, <code>shinyBS</code>, <code>shinyAce</code>, <code>shinyTime</code>, <code>shinyFiles</code>,
<code>shinydashboard</code>, <code>shinythemes</code>, <code>colourpicker</code>, <code>rjson</code>, <code>stringr</code>, <code>data.table</code>,
<code>lubridate</code>, <code>plotly</code>, <code>moments</code>, and <code>RCurl</code>. All the required libraries and
packages will be automatically installed with installation of <em>xROI</em>. The package
offers a fully interactive high-level interface as well as a set of low-level
functions for ROI processing.</p>

<p>Now, draw an ROI and the metadata.</p>
<p>Then, save the metadata and explore its content.</p>
<p>Now we can explore if there is any FOV shift in the dataset using the <code>CLI processer</code> tab.</p>
<p>Finally, we can go to the <code>Time series extraction</code> tab. Extract the time-series. Save the output and explore the dataset in R.</p>

<p>To familiarize yourself with the phenocam API, let’s explore the structure:
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/api/">https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/api/</a></p>

<p>PhenoCam time series are extracted time series data obtained from ROI’s for a

<p>To download the phenological time series from the PhenoCam, we need to know the
site name, vegetation type and ROI ID. This information can be obtained from each
specific PhenoCam page on the
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/gallery/" target="_blank">PhenoCam website</a>

<p>We now have a variety of data related to this ROI from the Hardwood Stand at Duke
Forest.</p>
<p>Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) is a measure of “greenness” of an area and is
widely used in Phenocam images as an indicator of the green pigment in vegetation.
Let’s use this measure to look at changes in GCC over time at this site. Looking
back at the available data, we have several options for GCC. <code>gcc90</code> is the 90th
quantile of GCC in the pixels across the ROI (for more details,
<a href="https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/PhenoCam_V1.html" target="_blank"> PhenoCam v1 description</a>).
We’ll use this as it tracks the upper greenness values while not including many
outliners.</p>
<p>Before we can plot <code>gcc-90</code> we do need to fix our dates and convert them from
Factors to Date to correctly plot.</p>

<p>Now we can see the transition date for each year of interest and the annual patterns of Gcc.</p>
<p>However, if you want more control over the parameters used during processing, you can run through the three default processing steps as implemented in download_phenocam() and set parameters manually.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the option to specify your own threshold used in determining transition dates.</p>
<p>What would be a reasonable threshold for peak greenness? Or autumn onset? Look at the ts dataset and phenocamr package and come up with a threshold. Use the same code to plot it here:</p>

<p>As Dr. Richardson mentioned in his introduction lecture, the same plant functional types (e.g. grasslands) can have very different phenologogical cycles. Let’s pick two phenocam grassland sites: one from a tropical climate (kamuela), and one from an arid climate (konza):</p>

<p>Now pull data for those sites via <code>phenocamr</code> or the <code>phenocamapi</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb346"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb346-1"><a href="phenocam-digital-repeat-photography-networks-methods.html#cb346-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;code here&#39;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;code here&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s create a subplot of your grasslands to compare phenology, some hint code below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb348"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb348-1"><a href="phenocam-digital-repeat-photography-networks-methods.html#cb348-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#some hint code for subplotting in plot_ly:</span></span>

<p>Once you have a subplot of grassland phenology across 2 climates answer the following questions in your markdown:
1. What seasonal patterns do you see?
2. Do you think you set your thresholds correctly for transition dates/phenophases? How might that very as a function of climate?
3. What are the challenges of forecasting or modeling tropical versus arid grasslands?</p>

<li><p>Pull mid-day imagery for September 1-7th, 2019 and 2020 for the canopy-level camera <code>NEON.D17.SOAP.DP1.00033</code>. Create a 2-panel plot showing those images in 2019 (left) and 2020 (right).</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>hazeR</code> package to quantify the haze in each of those images. Print a summary of your results.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a density function RGB plot for your haziest image in 2020, and one for the same date in 2019. Create a 2-panel plot showing 2019 on the left and 2020 on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull timesseries data via the <code>phenocamapi</code> package. Calculate the difference in the rcc90 between 2019 and 2020 over the same time period as your images.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a summary plot showing haze as a bar and the differenece in rcc90 from <em>question 4</em> as a timersies.</p></li>
<li><p>Answer the following questions:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Does the <code>hazeR</code> package pick up smokey images?</p></li>
<li><p>If you were to use color coordinates, which color band would be most useful to highlight smoke and why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional Bonus Points:</strong>
Repeat the above calculations for the understory camera on the same tower <code>NEON.D17.SOAP.DP1.00042</code> and produce the same plots. Which camera is ‘better’ and capturing wildfire? Why do you think that is so?</p>
